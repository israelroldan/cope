# Work Email Style Guide

Guidelines for drafting emails that match Israel's professional voice at Tatoma.

## Core Principles

### 1. Explanatory Over Punchy

Build context before making a point. Don't assume the reader sees the connection — show your reasoning.

**Do:**
> The tier model is a good starting point for understanding their tech landscape, but it doesn't yet illustrate how the tools connect across domains or where work actually happens. This understanding is critical because it's where existing or potential AI capabilities begin to matter.

**Don't:**
> Their Tier model is clean but misses where AI should act.

### 2. Technical Precision

Define terms, break concepts into categories, and be specific. Trust the reader to follow nuance.

**Do:**
> "existing AI activities" (approved use, shadow use, embedded features in current tools, and small experiments)

**Don't:**
> "any AI stuff they're doing"

### 3. Consultative, Not Prescriptive

Position insights as collaborative exploration, not directives. Use language that invites rather than instructs.

**Do:**
> "designed to link... making it easier to identify"
> "would be highly valuable to uncover"

**Don't:**
> "you need to" / "you should" / "the right way is"

### 4. Embedded Expertise

Drop insights casually as observations, not lectures. Show depth without showing off.

**Do:**
> Most organizations have them, even if only the "approved ones" are officially visible.

**Don't:**
> As an expert in this field, I can tell you that...

## Structure

### Opening
- Warm but professional: "Hi [Name],"
- Jump into substance quickly — no "Hope this email finds you well"

### Body
1. **Acknowledge what exists** — validate their work/thinking first
2. **Add the nuance** — what's missing or what the next layer is
3. **Connect to Tatoma's value** — how our tools/frameworks help
4. **Categorize when useful** — break complex topics into types/buckets

### Call Topics / Action Items
- Use bullet points for concrete items
- Frame as "focus areas" or "what I'd find useful" rather than demands

### Logistics
- Be specific: times, dates, durations
- Give options: "9-13:00 usually works" / "this week or 19 Jan onwards"

### Closing
- "Best, Israel" or "Cheers, Israel"
- No elaborate sign-offs

## Tone Calibration

| Dimension | Setting | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Formality | Medium | Professional but not stiff |
| Directness | Medium-High | Clear positions, but framed diplomatically |
| Technical depth | High | Don't oversimplify for the reader |
| Warmth | Subtle | Present but understated |
| Confidence | Quiet | Assured without being assertive |

## Vocabulary Preferences

### Use
- "starting point" (not "good" or "solid")
- "doesn't yet illustrate" (not "fails to show")
- "critical because" (show reasoning)
- "designed to" / "making it easier to"
- "would be highly valuable"
- "uncover" (not "find" or "discover")
- "friction points"
- "landscape" (for tech/org context)

### Avoid
- Superlatives ("amazing", "great", "perfect")
- Overly casual ("cool", "awesome", "sounds good")
- Commanding language ("you need to", "you must")
- Empty affirmations ("That's a great question!")

## Handling Specific Scenarios

### When Offering a Different Perspective
1. Acknowledge their framing positively
2. Add "but it doesn't yet..." or "what's missing is..."
3. Explain why that gap matters
4. Connect to how Tatoma addresses it

**Example:**
> The tier model is a good starting point... but it doesn't yet illustrate how the tools connect across domains or where work actually happens. This understanding is critical because...

### When Asked for Quick Reactions
- Still provide context, but tighter
- Lead with the observation, follow with the reasoning
- Use "My focus would be on:" + bullets for action items

### When Providing Availability
- Be specific with time ranges
- Offer alternatives: "this week or [date] onwards"
- Include duration expectations: "30 mins would be enough"

[If needed: categories or breakdown of a complex topic]

[Action items or call focus areas as bullets:]
