## January 2026 Update (as of Jan 23)

### Current Position
| Account | Balance |
|---------|--------:|
| ABN - 1533 | €6,418.18 |
| ABN – 7849 | €544.75 |
| Bunq Vakantie | €34.45 |
| Bunq Savings | €4.29 |
| ABN – 5854 | -€1.42 |
| **Liquid total** | **€7,001** |
| ICS Credit Card | -€2,304 |
| **Net liquid** | **€4,697** |

**Note:** GH salary (€6,386 "SALARISBETALING PERIODE 1") arrived Jan 11, not Jan 24 as expected.

### January Spending (Jan 1-23): ~€2,304 on ICS + ~€1,200 on debit
- 61 ICS transactions (mostly uncategorized)
- Key ICS spending: Parking ~€420, Apple services ~€275, EV charging €203, OMI hardware €175, Dev tools ~€200
- Debit spending on track for most categories
- Overspending: Groceries (+€81), Personal care (+€30)

### Bridge Plan: Jan 23 → Feb 24

**The problem:** Settlement delayed to Feb 24. Need to survive one month on current funds.

**ICS credit limit: €2,500** (charge card - full payment required each cycle)

**Timeline:**

| Date | Event | Bank Balance |
|------|-------|-------:|
| Jan 23 | Now | €7,001 |
| ~Jan 28 | ICS debits €2,304 | ~€4,697 |
| Feb 1 | Mortgage debits €3,372 | ~€1,325 |
| Feb 1-15 | Insurance debits ~€869 | ~€456 |
| Feb 1-24 | **All spending on ICS card** | €456 (safety buffer) |
| **Feb 24** | **Salary + Settlement arrives** | **+€25,719** |
| ~Feb 28 | Pay next ICS bill (~€1,300-1,550) | ~€24,200+ |

**Strategy:** Activate NEW ICS card now (kills old card + all subscriptions on it). Use new card for active purchases only during bridge period. Old card bill (€2,304) still debits from ABN on ~Jan 28.

**Card swap (Jan 23):**
- Activated new ICS card → old card dead
- All subscriptions on old card number will fail to renew (~€200-300/mo saved)
- Manually cancelled: LOCALS/Predator Poachers (~€10/mo, billed via Apple)
- Re-registered new card ONLY with: EasyPark, Q-Park, TAP (EV charging)

**Estimated Feb 1-24 spending (on NEW ICS):**

| Category | Estimate |
|----------|-------:|
| Groceries | ~€500-600 |
| Parking | ~€400-500 |
| EV charging | ~€150 |
| Other | ~€100 |
| **Total** | **~€1,150-1,350** |

**Headroom on card: ~€1,150-1,350** ✅ (better than before - no subscriptions!)

**Rules until Feb 24:**
- Minimize debit/cash spending (keep €456 buffer intact)
- Put EVERYTHING possible on new ICS card
- No large discretionary purchases
- €300 cash emergency reserve (do not touch)
- Do NOT re-register subscriptions until after Feb 24

### Feb 24 Reset

| Item | Amount |
|------|-------:|
| Feb 24 salary (new job) | €5,719 |
| Settlement | €20,000 |
| **Total arriving** | **€25,719** |

After paying ~Feb 28 ICS bill (~€1,500), you'll have ~€24,200+ and the planned €789/month deficit runway begins (25 months to April 2027 dividend).
