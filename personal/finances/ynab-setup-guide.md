## Important: Budget vs Reality

| | Monthly |

| Budgeted deficit (if you stick to plan) | €393 |
| Historical actual deficit (from bank data) | €2,300 |
| **Gap (overspending vs budget)** | **€1,907** |

**Where the gap comes from:**
- iDEAL purchases: €987/mo (not budgeted)
- Extra debit card spending beyond groceries
- Impulse purchases
- Untracked expenses

**The budget IS the cut.** If you follow this budget, you've already "cut" €1,907/mo of unplanned spending.

## Quick Wins to Reduce Budget Further

|-----|------:|----------:|
| Cancel Lottery | €31 | €6,081 |
| Cancel Luxplus | €9 | €6,072 |
| Reduce Apple (50%) | €147 | €5,925 |
| Cancel Nintendo | €77 | €5,848 |
| Cancel Z.AI | €47 | €5,801 |
| **After quick wins** | **€311** | **€5,801** |

Deficit after quick wins: €5,801 - €5,719 = **€82/mo**

That's nearly break-even with just subscription cuts.
