## Important Note on Methodology

The detailed expense breakdown below is useful for understanding WHERE money goes, but for calculating the actual deficit, use the **net flow method**:

- ABN Money OUT: €20,995/mo
- ABN Money IN: €19,284/mo
- **Historical net outflow: €1,711/mo**
- Plus income reduction: €581/mo
- **Expected deficit: €2,300/mo**

This avoids double-counting (credit card appears in both CC data AND ABN as bill payment).

## Summary (Detailed Breakdown)

| Category | Monthly Average |
|----------|---------------:|
| ABN Fixed Costs | €5,115 |
| Credit Card Subscriptions | €753 |
| Credit Card Variable | €580 |
| **Total Tracked** | **€6,448** |

**Note:** This total doesn't match net outflow because it excludes debit purchases, iDEAL payments, and other variable ABN spending. Use net flow (€2,300 deficit) for planning.
