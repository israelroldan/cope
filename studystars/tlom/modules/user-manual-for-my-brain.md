# Module 1: User Manual for My Brain

## MODULE OVERVIEW

**Topic:** Executive function, study skills, focus, and self-organization

**Target Artifact:** "User Manual for My Brain" — a personal document the kid authors about how their brain works, what helps them focus, what derails them, and the systems they've designed for themselves

**Age Range:** 10–15

**Duration:** 6 weeks (one 60-minute session per week)

**Pedagogy:** Socratic cycle mapping applied across the module
- **Week 1: OBSERVE** — notice and name how their brain works
- **Week 2: MAP** — identify patterns (when do I focus? when don't I? what triggers what?)
- **Week 3: DESIGN** — create personal systems and protocols
- **Week 4: TEST** — try the systems in real life for a week
- **Week 5: CODIFY** — refine what worked, write the final "manual"
- **Week 6: PRESENT & CELEBRATE** — share highlights with the cohort, parents invited

**Why This Module First:** Executive function is the foundation. Kids who understand how their own brain works can build systems that work *with* themselves, not against themselves. This module teaches the meta-skill of self-observation—a skill that applies across all future Library of Me modules.

## WEEK-BY-WEEK BREAKDOWN

### WEEK 1: OBSERVE — "How Does My Brain Actually Work?"

#### Pre-Read: "Brain Snapshot"

**Format:** Three illustrated character vignettes + implicit reflection prompts

**Characters and Scenarios:**

*Character 1: Kai (age 12, London)*
Kai is sitting at the kitchen table with homework due tomorrow. His phone is next to him. He starts working on math, gets through 5 problems fine, then sees a notification. He clicks it. Three minutes later, he's watching a video. Halfway through the video, he realizes he lost track of time. He goes back to homework, gets through 2 more problems, but now he's thinking about the video. After 30 minutes of "homework," he's completed 7 problems and the other 13 are untouched.

**What the pre-read reveals (implicitly):**
- Kai can focus for short bursts
- External triggers (phone notifications) interrupt his focus
- Re-engaging after a distraction is hard
- He doesn't have a system to manage his phone during homework

*Character 2: Zara (age 13, Singapore)*
Zara has a big essay due. She sits down to work. She reads the first sentence of the assignment. It feels big. She doesn't know where to start. So instead, she reorganizes her desk. Then she gets a snack. Then she texts a friend asking if they understand the assignment. Three hours later, she hasn't written anything, but her desk is perfect and she feels exhausted.

**What the pre-read reveals (implicitly):**
- Zara can focus once she starts, but starting is hard
- When overwhelmed, she avoids and busies herself with low-priority tasks
- She doesn't have a system for breaking tasks into smaller pieces
- She seeks external validation ("Does my friend get this?") before trusting her own understanding

*Character 3: Marcus (age 11, Berlin)*
Marcus loves building things. When he's building, he can sit for hours. His parents have to remind him to eat. But when it comes to homework, 15 minutes in, he says, "I can't focus." His mom asks, "What if you break it into 10-minute chunks?" Marcus tries it. After the first 10 minutes, he takes a 2-minute break. After the second 10 minutes, he takes a 2-minute break. By the end of an hour, he's completed homework that he thought would take three hours.

**What the pre-read reveals (implicitly):**
- Marcus *can* focus deeply on things he loves
- He struggles with tasks that feel "boring"
- Small breaks help him reset
- He doesn't realize that his "can't focus" feeling isn't permanent—it's something he can work with

**Implicit Reflection Prompts:**
- "Which of these kids is most like me?"
- "What's the difference between when I focus and when I don't?"
- "Is my problem 'I can't focus' or 'I don't have a system'?"

**Format Details:**
- 1-2 pages
- Simple illustrations (not cartoon-y, not overly stylized—just visual anchors for each character)
- Each character gets a text block (150-200 words) that reads like a real scene
- Ends with 3-4 reflection questions in a "Think about this before Thursday" callout box
- Reading level: 5th-7th grade (accessible but not dumbed-down)

---

#### Session Plan: "Brain Snapshot"

**Session Duration:** 60 minutes

**Cohort Size:** 4-6 kids (ideal for small group work and individual attention)

**Technology:** Zoom/Google Meet, shared screen with visual slides, breakout rooms if needed

**Facilitator Role:** Warm, organized, attentive. Not a coach—a space-holder. The kids are doing the thinking. The facilitator is asking good questions and affirming their observations.

---

**OPENING CHECK-IN (5 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Hey everyone, welcome! Before we jump in, I want to know how you're doing. We're going to go around the circle—each person gets to say one word for how your week has been. Just one word. No explanations needed. Let's go: [Kid 1], what's your word?"

*What you're doing:* Building psychological safety. Everyone speaks in the first 30 seconds. It signals: "Your voice matters here. You'll be heard."

*Expected Student Responses:*
- "Good"
- "Tired"
- "Okay"
- Silence (some kids freeze when put on the spot)

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- If a kid is silent: "No pressure. You can say your word or pass, totally up to you."
- If a kid says something negative ("Awful"): Light acknowledgment—"Rough week, got it. We're glad you're here."

*Tone:* Casual, warm, quick. You're not probing. You're just making space.

---

**PRE-READ DEBRIEF (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"So you all read the story about Kai, Zara, and Marcus before this session. I want to know: which of these kids felt familiar to you? And I don't mean 'which one are you exactly'—I mean which one's situation felt recognizable?"

[Give 15-20 seconds of silence. Kids are thinking.]

"Who wants to share?"

*Discussion Questions:*

1. "Which character's situation felt familiar?" [Listen. Affirm: "So you noticed that too."]
2. "What was different about Marcus's experience with homework versus his experience building?" [Guide toward: different activities, same person, different results]
3. "Did any of these kids remind you of something about your own studying?" [Go personal. This is the moment.]
4. "If you had to describe what your own focus feels like—not 'good' or 'bad,' but what it *feels like* when you're in it—how would you describe it?" [Listen for metaphors: "like a light switch," "like trying to hold water," "smooth," "jittery"]

*Expected Student Responses:*
- "Kai is me with my phone."
- "I'm like Zara. I don't know where to start."
- "I'm like Marcus, but I don't have a good system yet."
- Vague answers: "I don't really focus that well." [Follow up: "What does 'not focusing well' look like for you specifically?"]

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- If kids are quiet: "It's okay if these stories don't exactly match you. Just raise your hand if anything felt true, even a little bit."
- If kids give surface answers: "Okay, but what happens *right before* you can't focus? Like, what do you notice in your body or your environment?"
- If one kid dominates: "Thanks for sharing. Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet."

*Key Takeaway:* By the end of this 10 minutes, every kid should have named something about their own focus experience. Not "I'm good at focusing." But "I lose focus when my phone buzzes" or "I can't focus when I don't understand the instructions" or "I focus better in the morning."

*Facilitator Note:* This is observation, not judgment. You're not here to fix anything. You're here to help kids *notice*.

---

**CORE ACTIVITY: "Noticing Map" (20 minutes)**

*Setup (1 minute):*
"I want you to create a simple map of how your focus works. Not a perfect map. Just a snapshot. And we're going to do it together."

*Individual Work (8 minutes):*

Facilitator shares screen with a template that looks like this:

```
MY FOCUS SNAPSHOT

When I *can* focus:
[Space to write/draw]

When I *can't* focus:
[Space to write/draw]

One thing I noticed this week:
[Space to write/draw]

My best focus time is:
[Multiple choice: Morning / Afternoon / Evening / It changes]

What helps me focus:
[Space to write/draw]

What ruins my focus:
[Space to write/draw]
```

*Facilitator Script:*

"Take 8 minutes. I'm going to send this template to you. Open it in a Google Doc or grab a piece of paper. Fill it in for yourself. No right answers. Just notice. What's true for you?"

[Set a visible timer. Soft background music is optional—some kids focus better with it, some don't. You can mention it: "If you want to turn on some music while you work, totally fine."]

*What kids are doing:* Externalizing their internal experience. Getting it out of their head and onto paper/screen.

*Breakout Pairs (8 minutes):*

"Okay, time's up. I'm going to put you in breakout rooms in pairs. You've got 8 minutes. Show your partner your map. Talk about what surprised you—either about yourself or about what your partner said. If something's the same between you, note it. If something's different, that's interesting too."

[Assign pairs thoughtfully. Mix kids who might not naturally talk together. Avoid putting the most talkative kid with the quietest kid.]

*Facilitator Role in Breakout:* Pop in briefly to each room (2 minutes each if possible). Listen. Affirm. Don't correct or suggest improvements. Just: "Cool, so you both noticed you focus better with the door closed. And you focus at different times of day. That's really useful information."

*Full Group (4 minutes):*

"Come back, everyone. I want to know: what surprised you about your own map? Or what surprised you about your partner's?"

*Expected Responses:*
- "I didn't realize I focus better in the morning until I wrote it down."
- "My partner and I are kind of the opposite—they focus better with other people, I focus better alone."
- "I write it all down and it still doesn't feel like I understand it."

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- If a kid says their map doesn't make sense: "That's okay. Noticing is the first step. We're going to keep learning about this."
- If kids compare themselves to each other negatively ("You focus for like two hours straight and I can only do 15 minutes"): "Notice that—different people, different brains, different patterns. All useful information."
- If kids are quiet: "What felt true when you were filling out your map?"

*Key Takeaway:* Every kid walks away with a personalized, concrete observation about their own focus. Not a diagnosis. Not a judgment. Just: "This is what I notice about how I work."

---

**WORKBOOK TIME (15 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Now we're going to make this permanent. Open to page 1 of your workbook. This is your 'Focus Snapshot' page. I'm going to guide you through it."

*What the Workbook Page Looks Like:*

**PAGE 1: FOCUS SNAPSHOT**

Header: "My Focus Snapshot"

Subheading: "What I noticed about how my brain works"

Sections:

1. **When I can focus** (space for writing or drawing)
   - Prompt: "Think of a time this week when you got into your work and stayed focused. What was happening? Write it down or draw it."

2. **When I lose focus** (space for writing or drawing)
   - Prompt: "Now think of a time you tried to focus but couldn't. What happened? What pulled your attention away?"

3. **My focus feels like:** [fill in the blank]
   - "My focus feels like _______"
   - [Some kids might say "like turning on a lightbulb" or "like trying to hold water" or "like honey—slow but steady"]

4. **My best focus time:** [checkboxes]
   - Morning
   - Afternoon
   - Evening
   - It's different every day

5. **What helps me focus:** [list, drawing, or short sentences]
   - Prompt: "Music? Silence? A certain place? Being hungry or full? Specific drinks? Time of day? Other people? Time pressure? No time pressure? What makes it easier for you?"

6. **What ruins my focus:** [list, drawing, or short sentences]
   - Prompt: "What is the fastest way to pull your attention away from what you're working on?"

*Facilitator Script:*

"I'm going to read each section. You fill it in. There's no rush. If you don't know the answer, take a guess. If you want to draw instead of write, do that. This is *your* page."

[Walk around virtually. Check in: "How's it going?" Affirm: "I see you're really thinking about this." Don't correct.]

*Expected Behaviors:*
- Some kids will fill it in quickly.
- Some kids will stare at the blank page for a long time.
- Some kids will write very little. Some will write a lot.
- Some kids will ask, "Is this right?"

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- "Is this right?" → "There's no right answer. What's true for you?"
- Blank stare → "What's the hardest thing about homework for you?" [Start with a smaller question to unstick them]
- Very little writing → "Tell me about this. What did you write?" [Affirm it, don't push for more]
- Kids finished way early → "Want to add anything? Maybe draw something? Or just take a break—we're good."

*Differentiation:*
- **For kids who finish early:** "Is there anything else about your focus you want to remember? Draw it or write it on this page."
- **For kids who struggle:** Offer sentence starters: "When I focus, I usually... " / "The thing that messes up my focus is..."
- **For visual learners:** Encourage drawing/diagrams instead of writing.

*Facilitator Note:* This page is the foundation of the entire module. Everything builds from this observation. It doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be *true*.

---

**GROUP SHARE & CLOSE (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Before we wrap up, I want to hear what you discovered. Who wants to share one thing from their Focus Snapshot page? It could be something that surprised you, or something you're curious about, or just something you want to say out loud."

[Volunteers only. No pressure. 1-2 kids sharing is fine.]

*Sharing Prompts:*
- "What surprised you about your own focus?"
- "What's one thing that definitely helps you focus?"
- "What's the biggest thing that gets in your way?"

*Expected Responses:*
- "I focus better with music, which I didn't expect."
- "My phone is basically my enemy when I'm trying to do homework."
- "I can focus on things I like for forever, but everything else is hard."

*Affirm each share:* "Yeah, that makes sense." / "So music helps your brain work." / "You're noticing something real there."

*Preview Next Week:*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Next week, we're going to go deeper. You're going to look at your patterns—the times and situations when you focus best. Before Thursday, you'll get a new story. Read it. Think about what it means for you. See you next week."

*Send Off:*

"Great work today, everyone. Seriously. You just took your first look at how your brain works. That's the whole foundation of this module. See you next Thursday."

---

**KEY TAKEAWAY FOR THE FACILITATOR:**

Week 1 is about *noticing, not fixing*. Kids should leave feeling:
1. Seen: "Someone asked me about my focus and listened."
2. Curious: "I didn't realize that about myself."
3. Not broken: "This is just how I work—interesting, not bad."

If a kid leaves thinking "I have a focus problem," you haven't hit the mark. If they leave thinking "I have some specific patterns I can learn about," you nailed it.

---

### WEEK 2: MAP — "What Are the Patterns?"

#### Pre-Read: "Three Focus Patterns"

**Format:** Case study with three mini-narratives showing different focus patterns

**The Setup:**
The pre-read introduces the idea that different people have very different focus patterns—and all of them can work with the right system. It's not about being "good at focusing." It's about understanding your pattern.

**Character 1: Tasha (age 12, Lagos, Nigeria)**

Tasha's pattern: Sprint focus. She doesn't focus well for long periods. But she can absolutely crush it in short bursts.

*Scenario:*
Tasha has a history project due. She tried to work on it for an hour one afternoon. Made almost no progress. Got frustrated. Next day, she tried something different: she set a timer for 20 minutes and worked intensely. When the timer went off, she took a real break—went outside, drank water, moved around. Then she came back and did another 20-minute sprint. By the end of the day, the project was done.

**What the pattern reveals:**
- Tasha's brain resets with movement and space breaks
- She actually focuses *better* with time pressure (the 20-minute timer makes her focused)
- She's not "bad at focusing"—she's great at focusing, just for shorter bursts
- Her system: 20-min work + 5-min break + repeat

**Character 2: Roshan (age 13, Dubai, UAE)**

Roshan's pattern: Deep focus. He can't really "get started" quickly, but once he's in, he goes deep.

*Scenario:*
Roshan hates the first 5-10 minutes of homework. Everything feels pointless. But he doesn't try to fight it. Instead, he gives himself 10 minutes to "ease in." He reads the assignment slowly, makes notes on what he's confused about, asks himself questions. After 10 minutes, something clicks and he's in. Then he can work for 90 minutes straight without a break. His system: 10-minute warm-up, then long focus blocks.

**What the pattern reveals:**
- Roshan needs a slow entry ramp
- He actually thrives with longer focus periods (not the short bursts that work for Tasha)
- He's not "unmotivated"—he just needs a warm-up
- His system: 10-min intro, then deep work blocks

**Character 3: Amara (age 11, London, UK)**

Amara's pattern: Social focus. She actually focuses better around other people.

*Scenario:*
Amara noticed something weird: she procrastinates like crazy when she's alone. But if she does homework in the library or a café or even sitting next to her mom, she gets it done. Not because anyone is checking on her—just because other people being around makes her focus. So now she studies in the library, or in a group chat with friends (not talking to them, just knowing they're there), or at the kitchen table when her parents are working. Her system: create a "focus environment" with people nearby.

**What the pattern reveals:**
- Amara's brain works better with ambient social presence
- This isn't a weakness ("I can't focus alone")—it's useful data
- She can use this knowledge to design her environment
- Her system: choose locations where other people are nearby

---

**Implicit Reflection Prompts:**

- "Which of these patterns is closest to you?"
- "Could you use someone else's system, or do you think your pattern is different?"
- "If this is how your brain works, what could you design to help it?"

**Format Details:**
- 2-3 pages
- Simple, clean layout. One character per section.
- Each character gets a 200-250 word narrative showing their pattern in action
- End with a reflection box: "Which one is closest to your pattern? Or are you a mix?"
- Reading level: 5th-7th grade

---

#### Session Plan: "Pattern Mapping"

**Session Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Preparation:** Have slides ready with the three focus patterns visually represented (simple visual icons or illustrations that show Sprint, Deep, Social)

---

**OPENING CHECK-IN (5 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Welcome back, everyone. Last week you created your Focus Snapshot. Before we dig into today's activity, quick check-in: has anyone noticed anything about your focus since we last talked? Not a big thing—could be small. Didn't sleep well? Discovered your phone is a bigger distraction than you thought? Anything?"

[Allow 2-3 kids to share. Keep it light. You're reconnecting them to last week's learning.]

*Tone:* "We're continuing the conversation from last time."

---

**PRE-READ DEBRIEF (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Last week you read about three different focus patterns—Tasha's, Roshan's, and Amara's. Let's talk about what you noticed."

*Discussion Questions:*

1. "Which pattern felt most familiar? Which one were you reading and thinking, 'Oh, that's me'?"
2. "Here's a key question: Does that person's system—the thing that works for them—sound like it would work for you? Or would you need to change it?"
3. "If none of them felt exactly right, what do you think your pattern might be?"
4. "Here's the thing I want you to think about: Is there a 'best' way to focus? Or are all three of these ways equally good?" [The answer is: all three are equally valid. There's no one "best" way.]

*Expected Student Responses:*
- "I'm like Tasha. I lose focus after like 10 minutes."
- "I'm Roshan. I hate starting but once I start I'm good."
- "I'm like all of them, depending on the day."
- "None of these are me."

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- "None of these are me" → "That's cool. Your pattern might be something totally different. We'll figure it out together."
- Kids making value judgments ("Roshan's way is better because he can work longer") → "Here's the thing: if Roshan tried to work in 20-minute sprints like Tasha, he'd hate it because he wasn't getting into the work. And if Tasha tried to work for 90 minutes, she'd burn out. Neither one is 'better.' They're just different."

*Key Takeaway:* Kids should understand: different focus patterns aren't better or worse. They're just... different. The goal is to *know your pattern and design for it*.

---

**CORE ACTIVITY: "Pattern Matching" (20 minutes)**

*Setup (1 minute):*

"Today we're going to figure out YOUR focus pattern. Not guess. Not wish. Actually observe."

*Facilitator shares screen with three focus pattern cards:*

**PATTERN 1: SPRINT FOCUS**
- Best in: 15-30 minute bursts
- Breaks: Need movement, change of location, or water
- Feels like: Running fast, then needing to rest

**PATTERN 2: DEEP FOCUS**
- Best in: 60-90 minute blocks
- Warm-up: Needs 5-10 minutes to get started
- Feels like: Slow entry, then flow

**PATTERN 3: SOCIAL FOCUS**
- Works best: Around other people (even if they're not helping)
- Alone time: Struggles to focus solo
- Feels like: Energized by presence, drained by isolation

*Individual Work (7 minutes):*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Open page 2 of your workbook. You're going to answer these questions about your pattern. Be honest. These are for you, not for anyone else."

*Workbook Template (Page 2: Pattern Mapping):*

**Which pattern do I recognize in myself?**
- Sprint Focus
- Deep Focus
- Social Focus
- A mix of the above
- Something else

**If I picked one of the three, how is my pattern the same? How is it different?**
[Space for writing/drawing]

**When did I notice this pattern? (Give an example from this week)**
[Space for writing/drawing]

**If I could only pick ONE thing from my pattern to remember, what would it be?**
[Space for writing/drawing]

[Set a timer visible on screen. Give 7 minutes.]

*Facilitator Role:* Walk around (virtually). Check in quietly if a kid looks stuck. Affirm their thinking: "That's a great observation." Don't say, "That's right" or "That's wrong." Just affirm that they're thinking.

*Pair Share (8 minutes):*

"Okay, time's up. I'm putting you in pairs again. Show your partner your pattern page. Here's the question: Is your pattern the same as theirs, different, or a mix? Don't judge—just notice."

[While kids are in breakout rooms, pop in. Listen. Affirm: "So you're both Sprint Focus but with different break styles. That's a useful observation."]

*Full Group (4 minutes):*

"Come back, everyone. Let me ask: how many of you realized your pattern is different from what you thought before we talked about it?"

[Raise hands. Celebrate. "Yeah? So just noticing changed something."]

"Okay, final question. If you know your focus pattern, what's one thing you could do this week to work *with* your pattern instead of against it?"

[Listen. Don't offer answers. Let them think. Some responses might be vague—that's okay. You're planting the seed: "You can design for how your brain actually works."]

*Key Takeaway:* Every kid should leave with a concrete understanding of their focus pattern and one specific idea for how to design for it.

---

**WORKBOOK TIME (15 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"You already started page 2. Now I want you to finish it and then we're going to add page 3."

*PAGE 2 COMPLETION:*

Help kids refine their pattern page with any additional details or drawings.

*PAGE 3: PATTERN IN ACTION*

**Header:** "How My Focus Works"

**Sections:**

1. **My focus pattern is:** [filled in from the activity, but now refined]

2. **When it works best:** [describe the conditions]

3. **How I know it's working:** [what does it feel like? what signs do you notice?]

4. **When it breaks down:** [what makes it harder?]

5. **What I'm going to try this week:** [one small test]
   - Prompt: "Based on your pattern, what's one thing you'll try this week to see if it actually helps? (This doesn't have to be complicated. It could be as simple as: 'I'm going to try working in 20-minute chunks' or 'I'm going to do homework in the kitchen instead of my room.')"

*Facilitator Script:*

"You've got 15 minutes. I'm going to guide you through page 3. Fill it in for yourself."

[Read each section. Let kids write. No rush.]

*Differentiation:*
- **Kids finishing early:** "Do you want to draw what your focus pattern looks like? Or add any other observations?"
- **Kids struggling:** Offer sentence starters: "When I focus, I work best when..." / "I know it's working because..."

*Facilitator Note:* Pages 2 and 3 together create a "Map" of the kid's focus. It's not a diagnosis. It's a personal observation: "This is how I work."

---

**GROUP SHARE & CLOSE (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Before we finish, I want to hear about one thing you're going to try this week. Don't worry—you don't have to report back if it works. But I want to know what experiment you're running on yourself."

[Volunteers. 2-3 kids sharing is plenty.]

*Expected Responses:*
- "I'm going to try working in the kitchen instead of my room."
- "I'm going to set a 25-minute timer and see if that helps."
- "I'm going to ask my friend to do homework with me."

*Affirm each one:* "That's a great experiment. Report back if you want—I'm curious."

*Preview Next Week:*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Next week we shift gears. You know your focus pattern. Now we're going to design something that actually works for you. Your next pre-read will be about a kid who built her own focus system. Read it. Start thinking about what you might build. See you next Thursday."

*Send Off:*

"Great work, everyone. You just went from 'I can't focus' to 'Here's how my focus actually works.' That's huge. See you next week."

---

**KEY TAKEAWAY FOR THE FACILITATOR:**

Week 2 is about moving from self-blame ("I'm bad at focusing") to self-knowledge ("Here's how my focus works"). The workbook pages from Week 1 and 2 together create a clear map. By the end of this week, every kid should have:

1. A specific understanding of their focus pattern
2. Awareness of when and where it works best
3. One small experiment they're going to try

Success looks like: a kid realizing "Oh, I actually can focus—I just need to do it differently than I thought."

---

### WEEK 3: DESIGN — "Building My System"

#### Pre-Read: "System Builders"

**Format:** Case study showing two kids designing personalized focus systems

**Character 1: Liam (age 12, Sydney, Australia)**

*Scenario:*
Liam discovered he's a Sprint Focus kid. But his family has a problem: homework happens after school, and after school, Liam is tired. He can't do 20-minute sprints when he's exhausted—they feel pointless.

So Liam designed a system: What if he did homework *before* school instead of after? He wakes up 45 minutes earlier, does three 15-minute sprints, and gets homework done before breakfast. It sounds weird, but it works *for him* because:
1. He's rested
2. The sprints are short
3. Breakfast is his reward

Now every kid would hate waking up earlier. But for Liam, it's the system that fits his pattern.

**What the pre-read shows:**
- A system isn't one-size-fits-all
- It has to be designed *for your specific pattern*
- Sometimes the system isn't what you'd expect
- It's okay if your system looks weird to other people—if it works, it works

**Character 2: Sophia (age 13, Barcelona, Spain)**

*Scenario:*
Sophia is a Deep Focus kid. But she noticed she has a problem: getting started. So she designed a "startup ritual." Every time she sits down to do homework:
1. She makes a list of everything she needs to do
2. She picks ONE thing to start with
3. She reads the instructions slowly
4. She asks herself two questions: "What am I trying to figure out?" and "What's the first step?"

Only *after* that does she dive in. The ritual takes about 10 minutes. But it pays off: she gets into deep focus and can work for 90 minutes without a break.

**What the pre-read shows:**
- A system can be a ritual or a process, not just an environmental change
- Small practices (like a startup ritual) can make a huge difference
- The system is designed to fix a *specific problem* (for Sophia, it's starting)
- Systems are personal

---

**Implicit Reflection Prompts:**

- "What part of Liam's or Sophia's system could work for you?"
- "What would your system need to solve for you?"
- "What does a 'system' even look like?"

**Format Details:**
- 2 pages
- Clean layout. One character per page.
- Each narrative is 250-300 words, showing the system in action and why it works
- End with: "What problem do you want to solve with your system?"
- Reading level: 5th-7th grade

#### Session Plan: "System Design"

**Session Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Preparation:** Have a whiteboard/digital board ready to sketch out the steps of a system as you discuss it.

---

**OPENING CHECK-IN (5 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Welcome back! I'm curious: did anyone try their experiment from last week? The one small thing you were going to test?"

[Listen. No judgment. Some kids tried it, some forgot, some had mixed results. All good. You're building momentum.]

"Okay, great. Today is when it gets fun. You know your focus pattern. Now we're going to build something that actually works for you. Let's jump in."

---

**PRE-READ DEBRIEF (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"You read about Liam and Sophia and how they built their own systems. Let me ask you some things."

*Discussion Questions:*

1. "Which system sounded more like something you might try? Liam's change-the-time thing, or Sophia's startup ritual?"
2. "Here's what I want you to think about: Did their systems look like what you expected a 'system' to look like?"
3. "Liam's system is about *when* he works. Sophia's is about *how* she starts. What about you—what part of focus do you want to fix? When? How? Environment? Something else?"
4. "If you could design one thing to help your focus, what would it be?"

*Expected Responses:*
- "Liam's sounds crazy but also makes sense."
- "I could never wake up earlier."
- "I like Sophia's ritual. I need to get started somehow."
- Vague answers: "I just need to focus better." [Follow up: "Yeah, but what specifically? Is it starting? Staying focused? Taking breaks?"]

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- "I could never..." → "You might be right. That's why we each design our own. What would work for you?"
- Vague answers → "Let's get specific. When you sit down to do homework, what happens in the first 5 minutes? What's the hardest part?"
- "I need to just have more willpower" → "Here's the thing: systems are better than willpower. Willpower is hard. Systems are design. We're going to design something."

*Key Takeaway:* Kids should understand: a system isn't about willpower. It's about design. It's about building something that works with how your brain actually operates.

---

**CORE ACTIVITY: "System Sketch" (20 minutes)**

*Setup (2 minutes):*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Here's what we're going to do. You're going to design a personal focus system. It might be:
- A ritual (steps you always do before starting)
- An environment (where and when you work)
- A structure (how you break work into pieces)
- A combination

The system doesn't have to be complicated. It just has to be *designed for you*."

*Facilitator shares screen with a simple system design template:*

```
MY FOCUS SYSTEM

The problem I want to solve:
[Start? Staying focused? Taking breaks? Getting unstuck?]

How my brain works (my pattern):
[Sprint / Deep / Social / Mix]

My system will be:
[Ritual / Environment / Structure / Mix]

Here's what I'll do:
Step 1:
Step 2:
Step 3:
(etc.)

Why this will help me:
[How does this design match my pattern?]
```

*Individual Work (10 minutes):*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Open page 4 of your workbook. We're going to design your system. I'm going to guide you through each part."

[Read the first section: "The problem I want to solve."]

*Facilitator Script:*

"Think about homework. When you sit down to do it, what's the hardest part? Is it getting started? Staying focused once you start? Knowing how long to work? Something else? What's the thing that would help the most?"

[Give kids 3 minutes to think and write.]

"Okay, next part: 'How my brain works.' This is easy—you already figured this out. Are you Sprint? Deep? Social? Write it down."

[1 minute.]

"Now the big part: 'Here's what I'll do.' This is your system. Write down the steps. Don't overthink it. What would help? What could you actually do?"

[Give kids 6-7 minutes. Walk around. Help kids who are stuck with gentle questions: "What would help? What if you tried... ?" Don't tell them the answer. Help them find it.]

*Expected Struggles:*
- "I don't know what my system should be."
- "Isn't a system supposed to be complicated?"
- Writing too much
- Writing nothing

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- "I don't know" → "Let's start smaller. What's one thing that would help? Just one thing. Start there."
- "Complicated" → "Nope. Simple is better. Liam's system was: wake up earlier, do three 15-minute sprints, have breakfast. Super simple."
- Too much / too little → Affirm what they've done. Guide them to the right level.

*Full Group Share (8 minutes):*

"Okay, let's hear some ideas. What system did you design?"

[2-3 kids share. Listen. Affirm. Ask: "Why do you think that will work for you?" Help them connect it to their pattern.]

*Expected Responses:*
- "I'm going to do 20-minute sprints with a snack break."
- "I'm going to make a list of what to do, then start with the easiest one."
- "I'm going to do homework in the library instead of my room."
- "I'm going to work in the kitchen with my parents nearby."

*Affirm each one.* But also check: "Does that match what you know about your focus pattern?" [Help them see the connection.]

*Key Takeaway:* Every kid should have a concrete system—maybe not perfect, but something they could actually try.

---

**WORKBOOK TIME (15 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"You've sketched your system. Now let's make it real. Open page 5 of your workbook. We're going to add details."

*PAGE 5: MY SYSTEM (DETAILED)*

**Header:** "My Focus System"

**Sections:**

1. **What I'm solving for:** [restated from the sketch]

2. **My system has these steps:**
   [Numbered list of 3-5 specific, doable steps]

3. **Why this works for me:**
   [How does this match my focus pattern?]

4. **I'll know it's working when:**
   [What will be different? How will I feel? What will I have accomplished?]

5. **If it doesn't work, I'll try:**
   [A backup plan—not a failure, just plan B]

*Facilitator Script:*

"Take the system you sketched and make it more detailed. What are the actual steps? Write them down clearly. And write down: why do you think this will work? What will be different?"

[15 minutes. Walk around. Affirm. Help anyone stuck with their system.]

*Differentiation:*
- **Kids finishing early:** "Do you want to draw your system? Create a visual checklist? Something visual might help you remember it."
- **Kids struggling:** "Tell me about your system. What are the steps?" [Write it down for them, then have them rewrite it in their own words.]

*Facilitator Note:* This page is the core of the module. The kid has moved from "I can't focus" to "Here's my designed system." That's the learning.

---

**GROUP SHARE & CLOSE (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Before we go, I want to hear one thing about your system. What's the part you're most excited to try? Or most nervous about?"

[Volunteers. 2-3 kids.]

*Expected Responses:*
- "I'm excited to try the 20-minute sprints."
- "I'm nervous about waking up earlier, but I want to try it."
- "I'm curious if studying with my friend will actually work."

*Affirm the uncertainty too.* "Yeah, you're not sure if it'll work. That's why we're testing it. You get to find out."

*Preview Next Week:*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Okay, here's the mission: Next week, you're going to TEST your system. Use it this week. See what happens. Don't worry about it being perfect. Just try it. Your next pre-read is going to be about a kid who tried her system and figured out what worked and what didn't. Read it, then come back Thursday ready to talk about your own experiment. See you next week."

*Send Off:*

"You just designed your own focus system. That's real work. I'm excited to hear how it goes. See you Thursday."

---

**KEY TAKEAWAY FOR THE FACILITATOR:**

Week 3 is the pivot point. Kids move from observation and mapping to *action*. They've moved from "this is a problem" to "here's how I'm going to solve it."

Success looks like: a kid leaving with a concrete, doable system that feels connected to how their brain actually works. It doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be theirs.

---

### WEEK 4: TEST — "How's It Working?"

#### Pre-Read: "System Experiment"

**Format:** Case study showing a kid testing her system, troubleshooting, and adjusting

**Character: Isla (age 12, Toronto, Canada)**

*Scenario:*
Isla is a Deep Focus kid. She designed a system: 10-minute startup ritual (list, preview, two questions), then 90-minute focus blocks. She was excited to try it.

Day 1: She does the ritual. It helps. She works for 90 minutes. Success.

Day 2: She's tired. The ritual feels pointless. She tries to skip it and just dive in. Doesn't work. Takes 30 minutes to get into the work.

Day 3: She does the ritual again. It works.

By day 5, Isla notices something: the ritual works when she's rested. When she's tired, even the ritual isn't enough. So she adjusts: on days she's tired, she does 30-minute focus blocks instead of 90. The ritual stays, but the block size changes.

By the end of the week, Isla has a system that works, with a built-in adjustment for low-energy days.

**What the pre-read shows:**
- Systems aren't perfect on day 1
- Testing means noticing what works and what doesn't
- Adjusting isn't failure—it's how you make a system work
- The system evolves based on real experience
- It's okay if your system needs tweaks

---

**Implicit Reflection Prompts:**

- "How did Isla's system change from when she designed it?"
- "What did she learn from testing?"
- "What will you notice when you test your system?"

**Format Details:**
- 2 pages
- Chronological narrative: Day 1, Day 2, etc.
- Each day shows one observation: "Here's what I tried. Here's what I noticed. Here's what I'll adjust."
- End with: "What do you think you'll discover when you test your system?"
- Reading level: 5th-7th grade

---

#### Session Plan: "System Testing & Troubleshooting"

**Session Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Preparation:** Have a troubleshooting template ready. Kids will be bringing real problems.

---

**OPENING CHECK-IN (5 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Welcome back, everyone. This is the moment of truth. You designed a system. You tested it this week. Let's talk about what happened. But first: one word for how the testing went. Good? Hard? Interesting? Just one word."

[Go around. You're getting a sense of the room. Some systems probably worked, some didn't, some are half-working.]

---

**PRE-READ DEBRIEF (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"You read about Isla testing her system. What did you notice about how she figured out if her system was working?"

*Discussion Questions:*

1. "Did Isla's system work perfectly on day 1?"
2. "What did she discover when she tested it?"
3. "What did she do when she noticed something wasn't working?"
4. "Here's the key question: Is it a failure if you have to adjust your system? Or is it just learning?" [The answer: it's learning.]

*Expected Responses:*
- "No, it didn't work perfectly."
- "She noticed it worked better when she was rested."
- "She changed the time from 90 minutes to 30 minutes on hard days."
- "It's not a failure if you adjust—that's how you figure out what works."

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- If a kid says their system "failed" → "Did it fail, or did you just discover it needed tweaking?"
- If a kid says they didn't test it → "No judgment. Did you want to test it this week, or do you want more time?"
- If a kid's system worked perfectly → "Awesome. See if there's anything you want to tweak, or just keep going with what works."

*Key Takeaway:* Testing isn't about passing or failing. It's about discovering what works and adjusting. That's how real systems work.

---

**CORE ACTIVITY: "Troubleshooting Circle" (20 minutes)**

*Setup (2 minutes):*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Okay, so you tested your systems. Some things probably worked. Some things probably didn't work exactly as planned. We're going to talk through the real stuff. Who tried their system and has something they want to troubleshoot?"

*Process (18 minutes):*

[This is a peer-support troubleshooting activity. Kids share real problems and the group helps problem-solve.]

*Facilitator Role:* Hold space. Ask clarifying questions. Don't give answers. Help the group think.

*Example Flow:*

**Kid 1 shares:** "I tried the 20-minute sprints, but after three of them, I was so tired I couldn't do anymore. So the system doesn't work."

*Facilitator asks:* "Did it work for the first three sprints?"

**Kid 1:** "Yeah, those were fine."

*Facilitator asks the group:* "So the system worked, but she ran out of energy. What could that mean?"

**Kid 2:** "Maybe you need a bigger break after a few sprints? Like, not just water, but go outside?"

**Kid 3:** "Or maybe three sprints is the right amount for you, and you're done after that?"

*Facilitator:* "Both interesting. So maybe the system doesn't need to be 'do sprints until you finish homework.' Maybe it's 'do three 20-minute sprints, then take a real break,' and then you can decide if you want to do more. Does that sound right?"

**Kid 1:** "Yeah, I think that would work."

[Move to next kid. Repeat.]

*Expected Issues That Might Come Up:*
- "My system takes too long."
- "I keep forgetting to do the steps."
- "It worked one day but not the next."
- "I didn't try it at all."
- "I tried it and it worked perfectly!"

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- **"Too long"** → "Can you do a shorter version? What's the minimum?"
- **"Keep forgetting"** → "What if you wrote it down and put it where you work? Or set a phone reminder?"
- **"Inconsistent"** → "Is there a pattern? (Like, worked on well-rested days?) Maybe your system needs a backup version for hard days."
- **"Didn't try"** → "No judgment. Do you want to try it now, or do you want to redesign it first?"
- **"Worked perfectly"** → "Awesome. Keep going. See if there's anything to tweak."

*Full Group (after 18 min):*

"So what did we learn? What's the biggest thing about testing a system?"

[Listen for: testing shows you what works, adjusting is normal, your system will evolve, it's not about being perfect.]

*Key Takeaway:* Every kid should see that:
1. Testing is normal
2. Adjusting is normal
3. Systems evolve
4. Their classmates have similar struggles

---

**WORKBOOK TIME (15 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Now we're going to capture what you learned from testing. Open page 6."

*PAGE 6: SYSTEM TESTING NOTES*

**Header:** "What I Discovered"

**Sections:**

1. **I tested my system this week:** [brief description]

2. **What worked:**
   [What actually helped? What felt good?]

3. **What was hard:**
   [What didn't work as planned? What felt awkward?]

4. **What I learned:**
   [What surprised you? What did you discover about yourself or your system?]

5. **How I'm adjusting:**
   [What will you change for next week?]

6. **New version of my system:**
   [Updated steps, reflecting what you learned]

*Facilitator Script:*

"Fill out these pages based on your real experience this week. This is the truth—what actually happened, not what you wished happened."

[15 minutes. Walk around. Affirm the honesty. Don't judge.]

*Differentiation:*
- **Kids who didn't test their system:** "It's okay. Let's design a simpler version you can try this week."
- **Kids whose system worked perfectly:** "Awesome. Keep using it. Is there anything to tweak, or are you good?"
- **Kids with partial success:** Affirm. Help them see the wins and the adjustments.

*Facilitator Note:* This page is crucial. It shows the kid that testing leads to learning, not judgment. And it shows that iteration is part of the process.

---

**GROUP SHARE & CLOSE (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"I want to hear one thing: What did you learn from testing your system that surprised you?"

[Volunteers. 2-3 kids. Listen. Affirm.]

*Expected Responses:*
- "I realized I actually can focus when I take breaks."
- "My system needs to be flexible depending on how I'm feeling."
- "I didn't think it would work, but it did."
- "I thought I needed to do it exactly as I planned, but I learned I can adjust it."

*Preview Next Week:*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Next week is CODIFY week. That's a fancy word that means: make it real. You're going to take everything you've learned—your observation, your map, your system, and your test—and you're going to write your actual User Manual for My Brain. This is the artifact. This is the thing you're creating. Your next pre-read is about a kid writing her manual. Read it and think about what you want to say about your brain. See you next week."

*Send Off:*

"Great work, everyone. You tested something real. You learned from it. You adjusted. That's exactly how grown-ups figure things out. See you next Thursday."

---

**KEY TAKEAWAY FOR THE FACILITATOR:**

Week 4 is where the abstract becomes concrete. Kids aren't just learning about focus—they're living their learning. They're discovering that:

1. Systems need testing
2. Adjustment is normal and healthy
3. They can learn about themselves through experience
4. Failure is just feedback

Success looks like: a kid who tried something, discovered what works and doesn't, and adjusted. Whether it "succeeded" or "failed" is irrelevant—the learning is the point.

---

### WEEK 5: CODIFY — "Writing My User Manual"

#### Pre-Read: "The Manual"

**Format:** A kid writing her actual User Manual for My Brain—showing the process and what it includes

**Character: Priya (age 13, Mumbai, India)**

*Scenario:*
Priya has completed 4 weeks of observing, mapping, designing, and testing. Now she's writing her User Manual for My Brain.

She sits down and thinks: "What do I actually want to say about how my brain works?"

She writes:

**PRIYA'S USER MANUAL (excerpt)**

*Section 1: How My Brain Works*
"I'm a Social Focus person. I can't focus alone, but when other people are nearby, I get into the work. I don't need them to help me—I just need them to be there."

*Section 2: My Focus Pattern*
"I work best in 60-90 minute blocks. I need a 10-minute warm-up. If I try to dive straight in, it takes me 30 minutes to actually engage. Once I'm in, I'm in deep."

*Section 3: What Helps Me*
- Background noise (coffee shop, library)
- Other people nearby
- Knowing what I'm working on (no surprises)
- A list of steps
- 10-minute warm-up

*Section 4: What Ruins My Focus*
- Silence (feels lonely)
- Being interrupted mid-flow
- Not knowing what I'm supposed to do
- Hunger
- Checking my phone

*Section 5: My System*
"Here's what I do: (1) Find a place with people—library, café, or kitchen. (2) Spend 10 minutes reading the assignment and making notes. (3) Work in 90-minute blocks. (4) Take a break if someone interrupts me, then I can get back in."

*Section 6: When My System Breaks*
"On days I'm tired or sick, I need shorter blocks (30-45 min) instead of 90. If I'm in a bad mood, I work with music instead of ambient people."

*Section 7: What I Know About Myself*
"My brain isn't broken. It's just social. I used to think I had a focus problem. Now I know I have a focus pattern. Once I designed for it, everything got easier."

**What the pre-read shows:**
- A manual is a summary of what you've learned about yourself
- It includes patterns, systems, what works, what doesn't
- It's personal and specific, not generic
- It's useful—you can actually use it to make decisions
- It's not a diagnosis—it's self-knowledge

---

**Implicit Reflection Prompts:**

- "What would YOUR manual say?"
- "What do you want to tell yourself (or someone else) about how your brain works?"
- "What's the most important thing you've learned about your own focus?"

**Format Details:**
- 2-3 pages
- Structured like a real manual (sections, clear organization)
- Priya's manual is specific and practical
- Ends with: "Now it's your turn. What's in YOUR User Manual?"
- Reading level: 5th-7th grade

---

#### Session Plan: "Codifying Your Manual"

**Session Duration:** 60 minutes

**Facilitator Preparation:** Have a table of contents for a User Manual ready to show. Have pages 7-8 of the workbook printed and ready.

---

**OPENING CHECK-IN (5 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Welcome back to week 5. This is a big week. You've been observing and mapping and testing for a month. Now we're putting it all together. Before we start, how are you feeling about your manual? Excited? Nervous? Curious? Just tell me the vibe."

[Listen. You're taking the temperature. Some kids are ready to write, some are uncertain.]

---

**PRE-READ DEBRIEF (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"You read Priya's User Manual for My Brain. Let's talk about what you noticed."

*Discussion Questions:*

1. "What surprised you about what Priya put in her manual?"
2. "Did her manual seem like something useful? Something she could actually use?"
3. "What would YOU want to put in YOUR manual? What do you want to say about how your brain works?"
4. "Is a manual a list of problems? Or is it something else?" [Guide toward: it's self-knowledge]

*Expected Responses:*
- "Priya's was really specific. I thought it would be more general."
- "It was like... practical. Not just 'I have trouble focusing,' but 'here's exactly how to help myself.'"
- "I want to put my system in mine. And what works and what doesn't."
- "It's not a problem. It's just information about how you work."

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- "That's not what I thought a manual would be" → "Right? It's not a self-help thing. It's YOU explaining YOU to YOU (or to someone else who needs to understand you)."
- Vague answers → "What's the one thing about your focus you most want to remember?"
- Hesitation → "You don't need to be perfect. You just need to be truthful."

*Key Takeaway:* Kids should understand: a manual is useful self-knowledge. It's not about diagnosing problems. It's about saying, "Here's how I work."

---

**CORE ACTIVITY: "Manual Outline" (20 minutes)**

*Setup (2 minutes):*

*Facilitator Script:*

"You're going to spend the next 20 minutes creating the outline of your manual. Not the full writing—just the outline. What sections do you want? What do you want to say?"

*Facilitator shares screen with Priya's manual structure:*

**TABLE OF CONTENTS - USER MANUAL FOR MY BRAIN**
1. How My Brain Works
2. My Focus Pattern
3. What Helps Me
4. What Ruins My Focus
5. My System
6. When My System Breaks
7. What I Know About Myself

*Facilitator Script:*

"You can use Priya's structure, or create your own. The point is: what are the sections YOU want?"

*Individual Work (15 minutes):*

"Open page 7 of your workbook. I'm going to ask you questions. You answer them. These answers are the outline of your manual."

*PAGE 7: MANUAL OUTLINE*

**Instructions:** Answer these questions. Your answers will become the sections of your manual.

1. **How my brain works (in 1-2 sentences):**
   [Prompt: "Just say it simply. How would you describe the way your brain works?"]

2. **My focus pattern:**
   [Prompt: "What did you learn about your pattern?"]

3. **What helps me focus:**
   [Prompt: "List the things that actually help."]

4. **What ruins my focus:**
   [Prompt: "List the things that hurt."]

5. **My system:**
   [Prompt: "What's the system you designed and tested?"]

6. **Important to know about me:**
   [Prompt: "What else do you want to tell someone about how your brain works?"]

*Facilitator Script:*

"Answer each question. Write a sentence or two. This is your outline. Don't worry about it being perfect—just answer the questions."

[15 minutes. Walk around. Help kids who are stuck with gentle prompts: "How would you say that?" / "What did you notice about yourself?"]

*Full Group (5 minutes):*

"Okay, who wants to share one part of their outline?"

[2-3 kids share a section. Affirm. "So your manual is going to say..."  Help them see that they have the pieces.]

*Key Takeaway:* Every kid should have the outline of their manual—the main points they want to include.

---

**WORKBOOK TIME (15 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Now we're going to start writing the actual manual. Open page 8. This is where it comes together."

*PAGE 8: MY USER MANUAL FOR MY BRAIN (First Draft)*

[This is a long page or possibly a multi-page section. It's the actual manual—the artifact.]

**Header:** "USER MANUAL FOR MY BRAIN"

**By:** [Kid's name]

**Date:** [Today]

**Table of Contents**
[Kids fill in their sections, just like they outlined]

**Section 1: How My Brain Works**
[Prompt: "Write 2-3 sentences about how your brain works. Be specific. Be honest."]

**Section 2: My Focus Pattern**
[Prompt: "What's your pattern? Sprint? Deep? Social? Something else? Explain it."]

**Section 3: What Helps Me**
[Prompt: "Make a list or write sentences about what actually helps you focus."]

**Section 4: What Ruins My Focus**
[Prompt: "What gets in your way? List it or write about it."]

**Section 5: My System**
[Prompt: "Describe the system you designed. What are the steps?"]

**Section 6: What Else I Want to Know**
[Prompt: "What else is important for someone to know about how your brain works?"]

*Facilitator Script:*

"You have 15 minutes. Write your manual. This doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be true. Use your outline. Write each section. If you get stuck, move to the next one."

[Set a visible timer. Play soft background music if kids want it. Walk around. Affirm effort. Don't edit.]

*Differentiation:*
- **Kids writing quickly:** "Keep going. Add more detail. What else is true?"
- **Kids stuck:** "Tell me the answer. I'll write it down. Then you can rewrite it in your own words."
- **Kids wanting to draw:** "Absolutely. Draw it. A visual manual is just as good."

*Facilitator Note:* This is the rough draft. It's the kid's thinking, captured. It doesn't need to be polished. It needs to be real.

---

**GROUP SHARE & CLOSE (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Before we finish, I want to hear one section of your manual. What's the part you're most proud of? Or the part that surprised you to write?"

[Volunteers. 2-3 kids. Listen. Affirm.]

*Expected Responses:*
- "I wrote about my pattern and it made me feel better—like I'm not broken, I'm just different."
- "I didn't realize how many things help me until I made the list."
- "Writing it down made it feel real."

*Affirm with: "Yeah, that's the point. You're taking all this learning and making it real."

*Preview Next Week:*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Next week is the last week. We're finishing your manual. You're going to polish it, make it look nice, and then we're going to celebrate. Your pre-read next week is about a kid sharing her manual with people who matter to her. Read it and think about: who would you want to share YOUR manual with? See you next Thursday—this is the home stretch!"

*Send Off:*

"You just wrote your User Manual for My Brain. That's huge. You took everything you learned about yourself and you made it real. Next week we celebrate. See you Thursday."

---

**KEY TAKEAWAY FOR THE FACILITATOR:**

Week 5 is where abstraction becomes artifact. Kids aren't learning *about* focus anymore. They're documenting their own system. The manual is the proof of learning.

Success looks like: every kid leaves with a rough draft manual that captures their real learning about themselves. It doesn't need to be perfect or polished. It needs to be true.

---

### WEEK 6: PRESENT & CELEBRATE — "My User Manual"

#### Pre-Read: "Sharing Your Manual"

**Format:** A kid presenting her manual and what it means to her

**Character: Amira (age 12, Dubai, UAE)**

*Scenario:*
Amira completed her User Manual for My Brain. Now it's time to share it. The question is: why would she share it? What does it mean?

The pre-read shows Amira thinking about sharing:

"I could keep this just for myself. But I want to show my parents. I want them to understand why I work the way I do. I want my teacher to know that I'm not lazy—I just need specific conditions to focus. I want my sister to get that when I say 'I need to work alone,' it's not about her, it's about how my brain works.

When I shared it with my mom, she said, 'Oh, so that's why you're on the kitchen table doing homework.' I said, 'Yeah, I need people nearby. I didn't know that about myself until I wrote it down.'

Now my manual is helping people understand me. And it's helping me understand myself better."

**What the pre-read shows:**
- A manual is useful beyond just yourself
- Sharing it helps others understand you
- It's something to be proud of
- It's a tool you'll use going forward

---

**Implicit Reflection Prompts:**

- "What would it mean to share your manual with people who matter to you?"
- "What do you want them to understand about how you work?"
- "What's the most important thing in your manual?"

**Format Details:**
- 1-2 pages
- Personal and reflective, not instructional
- Shows Amira's thinking about what the manual means
- Ends with: "Your manual is done. What will you do with it?"
- Reading level: 5th-7th grade

---

#### Session Plan: "Polishing & Celebration"

**Session Duration:** 60 minutes

**Special Element:** Parents are invited to the last 15 minutes (optional, but encouraged)

**Facilitator Preparation:** Have high-quality paper ready if printing. Have a simple celebration planned (could be as simple as a toast or a moment of acknowledgment).

---

**OPENING CHECK-IN (5 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Welcome to the final session. We made it. You came in six weeks ago not sure how your brain works. You're leaving with a full manual. That's real learning. Before we start: how are you feeling? Proud? Nervous? Excited? What's the vibe?"

[Listen. You're honoring the moment.]

---

**PRE-READ DEBRIEF (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"You read about Amira sharing her manual. She showed it to her mom and her teacher. Let's talk about that."

*Discussion Questions:*

1. "Why did Amira want to share her manual?"
2. "How did sharing it help people understand her better?"
3. "Are you thinking about sharing YOUR manual with anyone?"
4. "What do you want people to know about how your brain works?"

*Expected Responses:*
- "Amira wanted her family to understand her."
- "It helps people get why she works a certain way."
- "Yeah, I want to show my teacher / parents / sister."
- "I want them to know I'm not lazy. I just work differently."

*If This Happens, Try This:*
- Hesitation about sharing → "You don't have to share it if you don't want to. It's yours. But it can be useful if you do."
- "No one cares" → "Your parents probably care. Your teacher probably cares. It might help them understand you better."

*Key Takeaway:* Kids should see the manual as both personal *and* useful for others. It's a tool for self-understanding and for helping people in their life understand them.

---

**CORE ACTIVITY: "Polish Your Manual" (20 minutes)**

*Setup (2 minutes):*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Your manual is done. Now we're going to make it look good. This is the polished version. It doesn't need to be fancy, but it should be clear and thoughtfully organized."

*Individual Work (20 minutes):*

Kids work on finalizing their manuals. They can:
- Rewrite any sections they want to improve
- Add drawings or visual elements
- Organize the pages in order
- Create a cover if they want
- Write a title page

*Facilitator Script:*

"Take 20 minutes. Finish your manual. Make it look good. Not fancy—just clear. And if you want to add a cover or illustrations, do that. This is YOUR manual. Make it represent you."

[Walk around. Affirm effort. Don't edit—this is the kid's work. Help them with logistics: "Do you want a cover?" / "Should we number the pages?"]

*Differentiation:*
- **Kids wanting to add a lot:** "Go for it. Make it beautiful."
- **Kids satisfied with their draft:** "If you're happy with it, we're good. You could add a title page if you want."
- **Kids wanting to rewrite:** "Sure, take the time. This is your artifact."

---

**WORKBOOK TIME (5 minutes)**

*PAGE 9 (OPTIONAL): REFLECTIONS*

*Facilitator Script:*

"One last page. Page 9. Just a quick reflection. What's the biggest thing you learned about yourself?"

*PAGE 9: WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT MY BRAIN*

**Prompt:** "Finish these sentences:"
- "I learned that my brain..."
- "The biggest surprise was..."
- "Now I know that when I can't focus, it means..."
- "I'm going to use this manual to..."

[5 minutes. Quick. Just capture the reflection.]

---

**GROUP SHARE & CELEBRATION (10 minutes)**

*Facilitator Script:*

"Okay, it's celebration time. Let's go around the circle one last time. I want to hear: one thing you're going to take with you from this module. It could be something you learned, something you'll use, anything. Who wants to start?"

[Go around. Every kid gets to speak. Listen. Affirm.]

*Expected Responses:*
- "I learned that I can actually focus when I have my system."
- "I'm going to show my parents this and ask them to help me with my breaks."
- "I know now that I'm not lazy—I just need the right setup."
- "I'm proud of my manual."

*Celebration Moment:*

*Facilitator Script:*

"Everyone, I want to say something. Six weeks ago, you came in not knowing how your brain works. You were guessing. You were maybe even blaming yourself. Today, you're leaving with a real manual. You know your pattern. You designed a system. You tested it. You wrote it down. That's not just learning—that's real work. I'm genuinely proud of you."

[Pause. Let that land.]

"Your manuals are going to be different from each other's. And that's the whole point. You're not supposed to all focus the same way. You're supposed to focus the way YOU focus. And now you know how."

[If parents are joining, invite them in now. Have kids read or share a section of their manual with their parent.]

*Optional: Parent Sharing*

[5-10 minutes. Parents listen to kids share. Parents are invited to ask questions: "Tell me about your focus pattern." "What helps you focus?" Just connection.]

*Closing*

*Facilitator Script:*

"This is the end of the module. But this isn't the end of your manual. You're going to use it. When you're struggling with homework, you're going to remember: 'Oh right, I focus better with breaks' or 'I need people nearby' or whatever your pattern is. This manual is a tool. It's yours. Use it."

[Final thought:]

"In a few weeks, you'll get your beautifully formatted User Manual for My Brain. You can print it. You can share it. You can keep it. But the real version is already with you—you know how your brain works now. That's what matters. Great work, everyone. You did real learning this module."

---

**KEY TAKEAWAY FOR THE FACILITATOR:**

Week 6 isn't just celebration. It's closure and transition. Kids are wrapping up their learning and beginning to integrate it into how they actually think about themselves.

Success looks like: every kid leaving with:
1. A complete, polished manual they're proud of
2. Concrete, usable self-knowledge
3. A sense of being seen and heard
4. Excitement (or at least openness) about the next module

### Core Tier Artifact

**Deliverable:** PDF version of assembled pages + physical printed workbook

The Core tier receives the raw workbook pages assembled into a PDF and the physical workbook they filled out. It's beautiful in its simplicity—the kid's actual thinking, organized.

---

### Premium Tier Artifact

**What the AI Processing Does:**

Parent submits the workbook pages → AI processes them into a polished, well-formatted chapter.

**Raw page example:**
```
My focus pattern is: SPRINT
When I focus best: in the morning, with breaks
What helps: snacks, movement, short timer
What ruins it: phone, hunger, too long without break
My system:
1. Put phone in another room
2. Set 20 min timer
3. Work hard for 20 min
4. Take 5 min break—move around, get snack
5. Repeat
```

**AI-Processed version:**

```
MY FOCUS PATTERN & SYSTEM

How My Brain Works
I have a sprint-focus pattern. I work best in short, intense bursts—usually 15-25 minutes.
After each burst, I need a real break, not just sitting still. The break includes movement
and often a snack.

My Best Focus Conditions
• Time of day: Morning (I'm fresher)
• Duration: 15-25 minute work blocks
• Environment: Quiet, phone out of reach
• Breaks: Active and with food/water

My Focus System
My system has five steps:

1. **Remove distractions.** My phone goes in another room before I start. This is non-negotiable.
2. **Set a timer.** 20 minutes. The time limit makes me focus more intensely.
3. **Work.** Full focus for the duration.
4. **Take a break.** At least 5 minutes. I move my body and get a snack or water.
5. **Repeat.** If I need to keep working, I do another cycle.

Why This Works
This system works because it respects how I actually focus. I can't do 90-minute blocks.
I CAN do 20-minute blocks with breaks. The system is realistic and sustainable.

When It Breaks
On days I'm tired, even 20 minutes feels long. On those days, I reduce to 15-minute blocks.
If I'm sick, I might do 10 minutes with longer breaks. The system is flexible.

What I Know Now
I'm not "bad at focusing." I have a specific focus pattern that works when I design for it.
The key is: sprint work + active breaks + removing distractions. When I follow this system,
homework that used to feel impossible becomes manageable.

```
SUBJECT: [Kid's Name]'s Week 1 in User Manual for My Brain

Hi [Parent Name],

This week [Kid] took a deep look at how their brain actually works.

The session opened with three characters—Kai losing focus to notifications, Zara avoiding starting big tasks, and Marcus discovering he can focus in chunks. As we discussed them, [Kid] said: "[Quote from your kid about their focus]"

This week's insight: [Kid] noticed that [specific pattern about their focus]. This is the foundation of the module—understanding that focus isn't something you either have or don't have. It's something you can observe and work with.

Next week, [Kid] will dig deeper into their personal focus pattern. They'll discover whether they focus best in sprints, deep blocks, or with social presence nearby. It's the beginning of their personal system design.

**If you're curious**, you could ask [Kid]: "Tell me about how your focus works. What did you notice this week?"

## PILOT NOTES

### What to Watch For

**In Week 1-2:**
- Are kids actually observing their own focus, or are they giving you generic answers ("I'm bad at focusing")?
- Are they seeing themselves in the characters? If not, the pre-reads might need more diversity.
- Are they excited or resistant? Resistance often means the pre-read didn't land.

**In Week 3:**
- Are the systems realistic or fantasy? ("I'll wake up at 5am" said without real commitment)
- Are kids connecting their systems to their observed patterns? Or just guessing?
- Are some kids stuck? Watch for patterns in what's getting stuck.

**In Week 4:**
- Did kids actually test? (Some won't. That's data.)
- Of those who tested, what happened? Did they learn something?
- Are they adjusting based on real experience, or making excuses?

**In Week 5-6:**
- Is the manual authentic? Does it sound like the kid?
- Are they proud of it, or is it perfunctory?
- Do they want to share it?

---

### Key Feedback Questions for Facilitators

**Post-Session Feedback Form:**

For facilitators to complete after each session:

1. **Which pre-read landed best?** (1-5 scale, plus notes)
2. **Which activity worked?** Any that fell flat?
3. **Did the timing work?** (Rushed? Too slow?)
4. **What surprised you about the kids' responses?**
5. **Did any kids struggle?** What was the struggle?
6. **What changes would you make for next cohort?**
7. **Overall vibe of the session?** (Energy, engagement, safety, confusion?)
8. **Anything else?**

**Facilitator debrief call (post-module):**
- 30-minute call with education expert
- Discuss what worked, what didn't
- Review common student struggles
- Identify pre-reads or activities that need revision
- Celebrate wins

---

### What Success Looks Like After 6 Weeks

**Indicators of success:**

1. **Completion:** 85%+ of kids complete all 6 weeks and have a finished manual

2. **Engagement:** Kids are showing up, participating, not just going through the motions

3. **Learning:** Kids can articulate their focus pattern (not perfectly, but clearly)

4. **Application:** Kids are actually using their systems (not all of them, but most)

5. **Ownership:** Kids feel like the manual is *theirs*. They're proud of it or at least satisfied.

6. **Parent feedback:** Parents see a change ("My kid is using the system we designed" or "My kid actually understands themselves better")

7. **Artifact quality:** The manuals are authentic and specific, not generic

8. **Repeat interest:** Kids express interest in doing another module

**Red flags (problems to fix):**

- Kids dropping out (indicates the module or pre-reads don't engage them)
- Vague manuals ("I need to focus more" with no specifics)
- Kids saying "This doesn't apply to me" (pre-reads might need more diversity)
- Parent confusion about what the module is (communication needs to be clearer)
- Facilitators struggling to follow the session plans (scripts might need more detail)

---

### How to Iterate Based on Pilot Results

**Data collection points:**

1. **Pre-read ratings** — which ones resonated? Which fell flat?
2. **Session timing** — which segments ran long? Which were rushed?
3. **Student responses** — what surprised them? What was confusing?
4. **Workbook completion** — which pages had the most struggle?
5. **Manual quality** — what were the best manuals? What made them good?
6. **Parent feedback** — what did parents notice? What excited them?
7. **Facilitator notes** — what would they change?

**Iteration priorities:**

1. **Pre-reads first.** If a pre-read didn't land, replace it. The pre-read is the engine.
2. **Session timing.** If a segment was consistently rushed, break it up. If it was slow, tighten it.
3. **Workbook clarity.** If a page had lots of confusion, rewrite the prompts.
4. **Facilitator guidance.** If facilitators were confused or improvising, add more detail to the scripts.

**Expected iteration cycle:**
- Run pilot cohort
- Gather feedback (2-3 weeks)
- Revise content and scripts (1-2 weeks)
- Run second cohort with improvements
- Further refinements based on second cohort

---

### Parent Expectations & Onboarding

**Family Library Card Conversation (15 minutes, parent + kid together):**

Before the module starts, parent and kid have a brief conversation to align on expectations:

1. **Module choice:** "Which module interests you?"
2. **Pace:** "How fast do you want to move? One module per month, per semester, or flexible?"
3. **Parent involvement:** "How involved do you want your parent to be? Just watch? Participate in some activities? Help with systems?"
4. **Ground rules:** "This workbook is YOUR space. Your parent won't read it unless you want to share it."
5. **Goal:** "This module helps you understand how your brain works and design a system that works for you."

**What to emphasize to parents:**

- This is not therapy or coaching—it's structured learning
- The workbook is the kid's property
- Success looks like self-understanding, not perfect systems
- The kid will get a real artifact they can keep
- Parent's role is supportive, not directive
- This is designed to take the burden OFF the parent ("You don't need to help with homework anymore—your kid has a system")

---

### Handling Common Challenges

**Challenge: "My kid won't engage with the pre-reads"**
- The pre-read might not match their life. Consider: Are the characters diverse enough? Are the scenarios relatable?
- Some kids need a version read aloud or summarized. Offer that.
- Some kids engage better with visual/comic versions. Consider a variant.

**Challenge: "My kid's system is unrealistic (e.g., waking up at 5am)"**
- Don't dismiss it. Let them test it. They'll discover it doesn't work.
- In Week 4, when they test it and it fails, they'll adjust. That's learning.
- Your role: "What will you do if that doesn't work?" (Get them thinking about Plan B.)

**Challenge: "My kid says 'I can't focus, period. Nothing works.'"**
- This is usually depression or anxiety, not a focus problem. Gently flag it to the parent.
- You're not a therapist, but you can notice: "I'm hearing that focus feels impossible right now. Is that what's happening?"
- Recommend parent check in with a counselor if concerned.

**Challenge: "My kid's manual is one page and vague"**
- Some kids work that way. That's okay.
- Your job isn't to make them write more. It's to affirm what they have.
- "What's one more thing you'd want to tell yourself?" Let them add if they want.

**Challenge: "My kid says 'This doesn't work, my system failed'"**
- Reframe: "Did it fail, or did you just learn something?"
- All data is good data. Failure is feedback.
- "What did you learn?" Keep them curious, not discouraged.

---

## FACILITATION PRINCIPLES

**Core Values:**

1. **Kid-centered, not prescriptive** — The system isn't "the right way." It's *their* way.
2. **Observation before judgment** — Notice patterns. Don't label them as good/bad.
3. **Experimentation, not perfection** — Test. Adjust. Learn.
4. **Autonomy, not dependency** — The kid designs their system. You facilitate.
5. **Psychological safety first** — Before any learning happens, kids need to feel safe.

**Facilitator Mindset:**

- You're not a tutor or therapist
- You're not fixing anything (the kid isn't broken)
- You're holding space for self-discovery
- Your questions matter more than your answers
- When in doubt, ask the kid: "What do you think?"
- Trust the process—it works

---

## CONCLUSION

The User Manual for My Brain module accomplishes something rare: it teaches a kid about themselves in a way that's actionable, personal, and real.

A kid walks in wondering if they're broken. They leave knowing: "Here's how my brain works. Here's what helps. Here's the system I designed. I can use this."

That's not just learning. That's transformation. And it's the foundation for every module that comes after.

Run it with confidence. The curriculum carries the weight. Your job is to hold space and affirm the learning.
