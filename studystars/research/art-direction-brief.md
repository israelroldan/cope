# Logo Design Brief: The Library of Me

## Brand Name

The Library of Me

---

## Brand Essence

A modular, student-centered platform where kids (ages 10–15) build a personal collection of real-world tools: systems, protocols, scripts, and playbooks they've designed themselves.

It's emotional, practical, and identity-shaping. It's not a course. It's a personal archive of capability and growth.

**Core attributes:** Agency, growth, clarity, modern self-authorship.

## Visual Tone

- **Modern and clean** — Not childish, but accessible to preteens and teens
- **Reflective, not preachy** — This is about self-awareness and identity
- **Human and warm** — Soft edges preferred over sharp corporate vectors
- **Structured but evolving** — Like a flexible system that grows over time
