# The Library of Me: Pitch Outline

## 1. The Problem

Today's kids are growing up in a world that demands more than just academic success. They need to:

- Focus and plan their work
- Handle stress, failure, and pressure
- Communicate clearly
- Make decisions, manage time, and follow through

**But:**

- Schools rarely teach these life-critical "human OS" skills in a meaningful way
- Most edtech solutions are either academic prep or fluffy "growth mindset" content
- High-expectation parents (especially in globally mobile or academically competitive families) feel this gap acutely

**The Pain Points:**

> "My kid is smart, but scattered."
> "They don't know how to manage themselves."
> "They freeze when it matters most."

## 2. The Insight

Kids don't need more advice—they need tools they've designed themselves.

Behavior shifts when learners see themselves as system builders, not just students. Confidence comes from knowing what works for me, not what worked in a video.

---

## 3. The Solution: The Library of Me

A modular, student-centered curriculum where each child builds their own living portfolio of real-world tools—one personal system at a time.

Each module solves one real-life problem (e.g. distraction, conflict, decision-making) by guiding learners through a repeatable 5-step process:

1. Observe their behavior and context
2. Map what helps or derails them
3. Design a personalized toolkit or script
4. Test it in real life
5. Codify what works into a tangible playbook

### The Playbooks

These playbooks go into their Library of Me—a personal, growing archive of protocols, reflections, and real outcomes.

**Examples:**

- "User Manual for My Brain" (study systems)
- "Talk Toolkit" (communication scripts)
- "My Focus Protocol" (attention + energy)
- "My Money Moves" (daily finance decisions)
- "Respect Scripts" (conflict + repair)

**The Core:** No abstract lessons. No lectures. Just real problems, solved by the learner, codified into self-designed tools.

## 4. How It Works

- **Modular:** 4–6 week programs, live cohorts + guided self-work
- **Artifact-focused:** Each module ends with a personal artifact, co-created and coached
- **Parent visibility:** Quotes, screenshots, weekly progress updates
- **Digital interface:** The Library of Me dashboard (downloadables, progress shelf, optional social layer)
- **Coach-led:** Trained guides using a repeatable instructional framework

---

## 5. Target Audience

- **Ages 10–15:** Early secondary years, when gaps appear but habits can still shift
- **Parents:** Tiger parents, globally mobile families, academic households
- **Early markets:** EMEA + LATAM, English-first, expanding into local languages with cultural adaptation

---

## 6. Go-To-Market Strategy

- Start with high-trust, niche cohorts (e.g. study skills for distracted but gifted kids)
- Parent pull → Social proof → Community flywheel

### Channels

- Organic content (module walkthroughs, student artifacts)
- Thought-leader/influencer partnerships
- Partnerships with premium tutoring brands or progressive schools
- Future pathways: B2B licensing, school-integrated models, localized franchises

---

## 7. Why It's a Business

- **High willingness to pay:** Visible results, personalization, short cycles
- **Pricing:** €120–180 per module or bundled access
- **Scalable:** Through coach training and standardized module architecture
- **Repeat usage:** Across years → increasing LTV
- **Strong IP:** Around methodology and module design system

---

## 8. The Vision

A new kind of education product: Not courses. Not tutoring. Not therapy. A toolkit for real life—designed by the learner, collected over time.

The Library of Me becomes:

- A personal growth record across early adolescence
- A portable, ownable showcase of capability
- A new category between edtech, coaching, and curriculum
