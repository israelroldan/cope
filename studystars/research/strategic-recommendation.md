# Strategic Recommendation: The Library of Me

## Target: Expat and Ambitious Families in EMEA/LATAM

**Niche:** Expat and globally-minded families with kids aged 9–16, navigating local education systems (e.g., IB, IGCSE, local curricula) but anxious about soft skills and future readiness. Think: parents working in multinationals, diplomats, or upwardly mobile urban professionals.

### Pain Points

- Lack of structured, high-quality programs for soft skills or executive function coaching in their own timezone/language
- Anxiety about their child's communication, confidence, organization, or ability to thrive in international schools or future careers
- Underwhelming school support for things like public speaking, leadership, focus, self-direction, etc.

## Initial Wedge: 6-Week Online Bootcamp

### Proposition

A short, high-trust, cohort-based experience that helps kids build a key soft skill while giving parents visible, trackable results.

### Example Programs

- "Focus & Flow: Executive Function Foundations for Kids 10–14"
- "Speak Up! Confidence and Communication for Ages 9–12"
- "Study Smart: Time & Task Management for IB/GCSE Teens"

---

## Why This Wedge Works

- **Scope-limited:** 4–6 weeks, weekly sessions, simple curriculum
- **Urgent enough:** Parents are often panicked about attention/focus, confidence, organization
- **Measurable:** You can use short diagnostics or parent feedback to show progress
- **Testable:** You can run small paid pilots with friends, school networks, tutoring centers, or WhatsApp groups
