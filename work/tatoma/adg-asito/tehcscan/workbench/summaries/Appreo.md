## API AVAILABILITY AND INTEGRATIONS

- **Custom API:** Available for third-party connections
- **HR & Payroll:** Deep native integration with AFAS, Nmbrs, and Loket (bidirectional sync + wage codes)

---

## OPPORTUNITIES / USE CASES

**Quick wins (ready now):**
- Maximize all 14 "Plan Accelerators" and smart indicators already available in the platform
- Verify recurring schedule features are fully deployed to reduce manual planning load
- Ensure AFAS bidirectional integration is fully optimized for payroll prep

**Vision / medium-term:**
- Explore Custom API to connect a third-party AI chatbot (e.g., for employees to query schedules via natural language)
- Evaluate "Best of Breed" strategy: ORTEC for AI schedule optimization + Appreo as execution layer (work orders, time registration)
- Formally request Appreo's roadmap on conversational interfaces and predictive analytics

**Gaps:**
- No native AI of any kind — all "smart" features are rule-based, not ML/AI
- No predictive analytics or prescriptive insights
- No content generation capabilities
- Appreo is not expected to become an AI platform — strategy should focus on integration

---

## KEY AI CAPABILITIES

- **AI Maturity: None** — Appreo relies on deterministic algorithms, not ML or GenAI
- **"Smart" features (not AI):**
  - 14 Plan Accelerators (drag-and-drop, quick suggestions after 3 characters)
  - Rule-based logic for scheduling (e.g., "if recurring, schedule every Monday")
  - Visual indicators for availability, compliance, equipment status
  - Capacity forecasting (deterministic, not predictive)
- **No branded AI assistant** (no equivalent to Jonas, Copilot, Breeze, or TESSA)
- **No conversational interface** — interaction via buttons and forms only
- **Reporting:** Descriptive only (actuals vs. budget)

**Comparison to AI-enabled competitors:**
| Feature | Appreo | AI-Enabled (e.g. ORTEC) |
|---------|--------|-------------------------|
| Scheduling | Manual + rule-based helpers | AI/ML optimization |
| Interaction | Buttons/forms | Conversational |
| Reporting | Descriptive | Predictive & prescriptive |
| Content | User-generated only | GenAI drafting |

## KEY LIMITATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS

- **No AI capabilities:** All automation is rule-based, not intelligent
- **No conversational interface:** Employees cannot query schedules in natural language
- **No predictive analytics:** Cannot forecast demand, absence, or staffing needs
- **External dependency:** Financial data accuracy relies on ERP integration stability
- **Privacy considerations:** Employee location data + precise time tracking requires strict internal policy adherence
- **Mobile limitations:** Planners need tablet/desktop for backend adjustments; no full-featured phone app for planning
- **No content generation:** No AI-assisted report writing, email drafting, or document analysis
