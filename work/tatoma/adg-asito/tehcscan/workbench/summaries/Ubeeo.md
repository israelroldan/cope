## OPPORTUNITIES / USE CASES

**Quick wins (ready now):**
- **AI Interview Analysis (In2Dialog):** Record interviews → automatic transcription + psychological assessment of personality/motivations → saves ~30 min/interview
- **Instant Candidate Matching (WCC):** Post vacancy → semantic scan of talent pool → ranked list with "Match %" based on skills, location, experience → resurface silver-medalist candidates
- **Automated Application Screening:** Weighted questions → auto-score → trigger actions (invite >80%, reject <50%, hold for review) → 0% backlog on initial review

**Vision / medium-term:**
- Pilot Textmetrics for AI-optimized job descriptions (inclusivity + branding)
- Request Ubeeo's 2026-2027 roadmap on native GenAI features vs. further partner dependency
- Consider pairing Ubeeo with Microsoft Copilot for "chat with recruitment data" capability
- Ensure AFAS integration is optimized so AI scoring flows seamlessly into onboarding

---

## KEY AI CAPABILITIES

- **Native AI (limited):**
  - Generative content: AI-assisted drafting/optimization of job descriptions (new feature)
  - Application scoring: Configurable weighted algorithms for automated pre-screening (auto-reject, auto-invite thresholds)
  - Workflow automation: Rules-based triggers (social media posting, SMS reminders, self-service interview scheduling)
- **Partner-driven AI (core strength):**
  - **In2Dialog:** Interview recording → transcription → psychological profiling → automated summaries (~30 min saved/interview)
  - **WCC ELISE:** Semantic candidate matching (context-aware, synonym-based — not just keywords)
  - **Textmetrics:** Real-time writing insights for inclusive, SEO-optimized job postings
  - **Pi Company / SHL:** Psychometric pre-employment testing integration

---

## KEY LIMITATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS

- **No branded AI assistant:** No conversational chatbot or copilot equivalent — no "chat with your data" capability
- **Partner dependency (High risk):** Advanced AI features rely on 3rd parties (In2Dialog, WCC). If partnerships dissolve, functionality is lost.
- **Limited native GenAI:** Generative AI is limited to job description drafting only
- **No predictive analytics:** Cannot forecast hiring needs, time-to-fill, or recruitment pipeline health
- **No autonomous agents:** Workflow automation is rules-based, not AI-driven
- **GDPR sensitivity:** In2Dialog interview recording requires strict consent management and data retention policies
- **Algorithmic bias risk:** AI matching and scoring (WCC/native) must be regularly audited to prevent demographic disadvantaging, especially in automated rejection workflows
- **No "chat with data":** Cannot query recruitment data via natural language — must pair with external tool

- **Reference:** In2Dialog partnership (Oct 2024); Textmetrics partnership (June 2025)
- **Note:** Best showcased in combination with AFAS (native integration) for end-to-end hiring → onboarding flow
