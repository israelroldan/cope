# AI Readiness Report: Ubeeo

**Client**: Asito (part of ADG)
**Date**: February 5, 2025
**Focus Area**: Recruitment & Applicant Tracking

---

## Executive Summary

Ubeeo is a Dutch-based ATS (Applicant Tracking System) provider founded in 2004, headquartered in Rotterdam. The platform focuses on making recruitment processes more efficient through smart matching, career site integration, and workflow automation. Unlike products with dedicated conversational AI assistants (like HubSpot Breeze or ORTEC TESSA), **Ubeeo does not have a branded AI assistant**. However, they have a strong third-party AI integration strategy, most notably their October 2024 partnership with **In2Dialog**, an award-winning AI-powered interview analysis tool.

## Branded AI Assistant

| Attribute | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| **Name** | None (no branded AI assistant) |
| **Native AI** | Limited – Smart matching via WCC partnership |
| **AI Integration** | Strong – In2Dialog partnership (October 2024) |
| **AI Positioning** | Partner ecosystem approach rather than native AI development |

---

## AI Capabilities (What It CAN Do)

### 1. Smart Matching (via WCC Partnership)

Ubeeo integrates with WCC's ELISE Smart Search & Match engine to provide:

- **Semantic matching** between candidates and vacancies
- **CV parsing** – automatically extracts data from uploaded resumes
- **Synonym recognition** – understands contextual meaning, not just keywords
- **Matching scores** – visual percentage fit for candidates
- **Configurable weighting** – prioritize factors like commute distance, experience, or soft skills
- **Multilingual support** – matching works across languages

> **Demo-ready use case**: Post a new vacancy and instantly see a ranked list of matching candidates from your talent pool, with percentage scores based on skills, experience, and configurable criteria like location.

### 2. AI-Powered Interview Analysis (via In2Dialog)

As of October 2024, Ubeeo users can access In2Dialog's AI capabilities:

- **Interview recording** – captures both in-person and online interviews
- **Automatic transcription** – AI generates full interview transcripts
- **AI analysis** – thematic and syntactic content analysis
- **Psychological profiling** – quantifies candidate interests, motivations, skills, personality aspects
- **Automated summaries** – no more manual post-interview reports
- **Time savings** – up to 30 minutes saved per interview

> **Demo-ready use case**: Conduct interviews normally, let In2Dialog record and transcribe them, then review AI-generated summaries and candidate personality insights directly within Ubeeo ATS – without writing a single note.

### 3. Application Form Scoring

- Configure questions with weighted answer scores
- Automatic follow-up actions based on total score
- Pre-screen candidates before manual review

> **Demo-ready use case**: Create an application form where answers about experience levels automatically score candidates. A candidate scoring 80%+ gets auto-invited to interview; below 50% receives a rejection email.

### 4. Automated Workflow Actions

- Automatic career site posting when vacancy is published
- Social media sharing integration
- SMS reminders to reduce no-shows
- Self-service interview scheduling for candidates
