# AI Readiness Report: Appreo

**Prepared for:** Asito (part of ADG)
**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Focus Area:** Planning, Work Orders & Time Registration

---

## Executive Summary

Appreo is a Dutch SaaS platform for planning, work orders, time registration, and payroll—purpose-built for the cleaning and facility services industry. **Asito has been using Appreo since January 1, 2021** for specialist and periodic cleaning operations. Unlike HubSpot (Breeze) or ORTEC (TESSA), Appreo does **not have a branded conversational AI assistant**. Instead, Appreo focuses on **smart automation**, rule-based planning optimization, and seamless integrations. The platform is highly relevant to Asito's operations but represents a different AI maturity level—strong on automation, limited on generative AI.

## Branded AI Assistant

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Name** | **None** - No branded AI assistant |
| **AI Approach** | Smart automation, rule-based planning indicators |
| **Support AI** | AI Agent for customer support (answers common questions) |
| **Positioning** | "Slimmer vakwerk begint met Appreo" (Smarter professional work starts with Appreo) |

**Note:** Appreo does not offer a conversational AI assistant like TESSA (ORTEC) or Breeze (HubSpot). Their "smartness" comes from automated workflows, planning indicators, and integration-driven efficiency rather than generative AI or natural language interfaces.
