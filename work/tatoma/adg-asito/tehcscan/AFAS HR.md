# AI Readiness Report: AFAS Software (as HR System)

**Prepared for:** Asito (part of ADG)
**Date:** February 8, 2026
**Prepared by:** Tatoma

---

## Executive Summary

AFAS Software is a Dutch cloud-based platform used by over 14,000 organizations and processing payroll for 3.8 million workers. Assessed specifically as an HR system, AFAS offers a tightly integrated HRM and payroll suite with native AI capabilities through its **Jonas** assistant. Jonas is embedded directly into HR workflows — automating text generation for employee questions, analyzing CVs in recruitment, transcribing performance conversations, and processing expense receipts. For Asito (ADG), a facility services company with high employee volumes and complex CAO requirements (CAO Schoonmaak), AFAS's HR AI capabilities are directly applicable — particularly for recruitment at scale, absence management, and field-based HR operations. However, AFAS currently lacks predictive workforce analytics, advanced talent intelligence, and conversational AI for employee self-service, which are areas where third-party integrations or future Profit 8 features (June 2026) could fill the gaps.

## AI Capabilities in the HR Domain — What Jonas CAN Do

### 1. Automated Answering of Employee Questions
Jonas can automatically draft responses to employee questions submitted through HR workflows. The HR advisor only needs to review and approve the suggested answer before sending it.

> **Customer case — Zorggroep Sint Maarten:** Their HR, payroll, and functional management teams receive a high volume of employee questions annually. Jonas proposes answers automatically, saving ~6 hours/month. The HR team only reviews and forwards.

**HR relevance for Asito:** With thousands of employees across cleaning sites, the volume of HR questions (about leave, pay, contracts, etc.) is likely substantial. Jonas could significantly reduce response time.

### 2. AI-Powered Recruitment Screening
Jonas can analyze a vacancy description, motivation letter, and CV together within the recruitment workflow, producing a structured assessment that helps hiring managers make faster decisions.

> **Customer case — Zorggroep Sint Maarten:** Jonas is part of their recruitment workflow. It analyzes the vacancy, motivation letter, and CV, and produces an assessment. For popular vacancies with many applicants, this helps managers evaluate candidates much more efficiently. Compliance with anti-discrimination legislation is factored in.

**HR relevance for Asito:** High-volume recruitment in facility services means many applications per vacancy. AI-assisted screening can accelerate hiring while maintaining consistency.

### 3. Performance Conversation Transcription & Reporting
Managers can record performance conversations using AFAS Pocket or Apple Watch. Jonas transcribes the recording and can generate a structured conversation report, extracting goals and improvement areas into separate fields.

> **Customer case — BACU:** Leaders use Jonas to record employee conversations and auto-generate reports. They can focus on the actual conversation (listening) rather than note-taking.

> **Future (Profit 8):** Jonas will be able to capture conversation summaries in separate fields and extract specific goals/improvement areas automatically.

**HR relevance for Asito:** Team leaders and site managers conducting periodic performance reviews can use voice recording in the field, rather than filling in forms at a desk.

### 4. Document-Aware HR Analysis
Jonas can reference attached HR documents (employment conditions, collective labor agreements, internal policies) within workflows and provide summaries, analyses, or extract specific information.

> **Example:** In a contract renewal workflow, Jonas can summarize relevant CAO provisions and highlight changes since the last contract period.

**HR relevance for Asito:** The CAO Schoonmaak is complex and updated regularly. Jonas can help HR advisors quickly understand implications of CAO changes for specific employee situations.

### 5. Receipt & Expense OCR
AFAS Pocket uses AI-powered text recognition to scan expense receipts and auto-fill amount, date, and description fields.

**HR relevance for Asito:** Field staff (team leaders, supervisors) can photograph receipts on-site and submit expense claims immediately — reducing manual data entry and paper-based processes.

### 6. AI Task Templates for HR Workflows
Administrators can create standardized Jonas prompts (templates) for recurring HR workflow steps. These are invoked by users via a button or keyboard shortcut.

> **Examples:** "Summarize this dossier item," "Draft a rejection email for this applicant," "Analyze this sick leave history," "Suggest development goals based on this review."

**HR relevance for Asito:** Standardized AI templates ensure consistent quality across HR operations, regardless of which HR advisor handles the case.

### 7. Translation
Jonas can translate HR documents and workflow fields to English, French, German, or Dutch (Belgium) with one click.

**HR relevance for Asito:** ADG operates internationally. Translation of HR communications, contracts, or policy documents across regions is simplified.

### 8. Smart Reactions on Dossier Items
Any user can invoke Jonas on any dossier item to summarize, rewrite, shorten, lengthen, or change the tone of text — no admin setup required.

**HR relevance for Asito:** Quick summarization of lengthy employee dossiers (e.g., before a re-integration meeting or performance review).

## AI Capabilities Coming Soon — Profit 8 (June 2026)

| Feature | Description | HR Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **CV Parsing** | Jonas extracts information from CVs and cover letters, auto-populating dossier fields in recruitment workflows | Reduces manual data entry in high-volume hiring |
| **AI Talent Matching** | AFAS suggests applicant-to-vacancy matches based on CVs and competencies, including cross-vacancy recommendations ("this person applied for vacancy A but fits vacancy B better") | Particularly valuable for facility services with many similar roles across locations |
| **Jonas in All Workflows** | Jonas automation deployable across all existing workflows with full self-configuration | Enables AI in any HR process without waiting for AFAS to build specific templates |
| **Enhanced Speech-to-Text** | AI analysis on audio files in workflows — transcription + automatic extraction of tasks and action points | Performance reviews, incident reports, handover notes can all be voice-recorded and auto-processed |
| **Performance Field Extraction** | Jonas captures conversation summaries in separate fields and extracts goals/improvement areas | Structured performance data without manual input |

## AI Limitations in the HR Domain — What Jonas CAN'T Do

| Limitation | Detail | Impact for Asito |
|---|---|---|
| **No predictive workforce analytics** | Jonas does not offer AI-driven forecasting for turnover, absenteeism, or staffing demand. BI dashboards are descriptive (Power BI), not predictive. | Asito cannot use native AFAS tools to predict seasonal demand, flight risk, or absence trends. Requires third-party analytics. |
| **No conversational HR chatbot** | Jonas is workflow-embedded, not a free-form chatbot. Employees cannot ask Jonas questions directly (e.g., "How many leave days do I have left?"). | Employee self-service remains form-based. No conversational AI for routine HR queries. |
| **No automated scheduling/rostering AI** | AFAS does not include AI-optimized workforce scheduling or shift planning. | Critical gap for facility services where scheduling hundreds of cleaners across sites is a core challenge. Requires dedicated WFM tools. |
| **No sentiment analysis** | Jonas does not analyze employee sentiment from surveys, reviews, or communications. | No native tool for engagement monitoring or early warning of dissatisfaction. |
| **No skills inference or talent intelligence** | Current system tracks manually entered competencies. No AI-driven skill inference from work history or learning data. (Talent matching coming in Profit 8.) | Skills-based workforce management is limited until Profit 8 launches. |
| **No autonomous decision-making** | Jonas generates text and suggestions. All outputs require human review and approval. | Every AI suggestion needs a human in the loop — good for compliance, but limits full automation. |
| **Outputs require prompt tuning** | Initial Jonas outputs may be generic or imprecise. Administrators must iteratively refine prompts using Jonas Insights feedback. | Investment needed in prompt engineering to get high-quality, Asito-specific AI outputs. |
| **Limited to AFAS ecosystem** | Jonas cannot pull data from external systems (e.g., planning tools, time & attendance systems, external learning platforms). | If Asito uses separate WFM or T&A systems, Jonas cannot incorporate that data. |
| **No image/video analysis** | Text and audio only. No computer vision for document verification, ID checks, or video-based assessments. | Document verification (e.g., identity checks for new hires) remains manual. |
