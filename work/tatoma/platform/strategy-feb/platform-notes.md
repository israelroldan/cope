# Tatoma Strategy Session - Platform & Offering Evolution
**Date:** Thursday, February 12, 2026
**Participants:** Israel + 2 co-founders (3 people total)

---

## Context & Starting Point

The session was driven by Israel feeling that the current offering is too broad, not differentiated enough, and that energy is dropping because the pitch doesn't feel sharp. Key trigger: competitors are all converging on the same "strategy + use cases + training + mindset" message, and the team needs to figure out what sets Tatoma apart.

The morning session (4h) focused on diagnosing the problem — mapping client needs vs. what Tatoma offers, reviewing competitors, and identifying where energy and value actually live. The afternoon session (2h15m) moved into structuring a revised offering model.

## The Core Problem Identified

- Everybody in the AI consulting space is now saying the same thing: strategy, use cases, training, it's about people not tech, mindset change. A year ago this was differentiated; now it's table stakes.
- The execution support model (biweekly check-ins, ad-hoc help) is the least scalable part of the business and carries most of the pricing weight.
- The team is spreading too thin — doing "everything a little bit" instead of going deep on a few things.
- The standardization claim isn't unique enough yet. Competitors also have templates, workshops, and repeatable models. Tatoma needs to take standardization "more to the extreme."
- The align/activate/adopt framework feels confusing internally — the team struggles to map concrete deliverables to these phases.

---

## What's Working Well

- **Teamwork is in place** — three co-founders, market traction, cash flow.
- **Clients aren't leaving** — there's demand, people like the brand.
- **Foundation sessions** — the playbook creation process and facilitated strategy discussions are generating real value. Getting better with each client.
- **The compounding effect** — each engagement gets stronger (e.g., sessions are "much stronger than what we did with Pro").
- **Breakthrough sprints** — when the team goes deep with a client team on a specific use case or challenge, that's where breakthroughs happen. Both founders said this is the part they enjoy most.

---

## What's Not Working

- **Execution support is vague and unscalable** — coaching on the sideline feels out of control. Jaspers (client project leads) get stuck and the team ends up doing scattered work.
- **No energy from 1:1 check-ins** — "An hour with that person, and then they start doing something. And I'm completely out of control."
- **IT discussions pull the team out of scope** — use cases quickly turn into IT landscape conversations (security, infrastructure, governance) which are beyond Tatoma's depth.
- **The product story isn't clear** — when asked "what are you building?", there's no crisp answer.

## Revised Offering Model

### The Structure: Transform + Accelerate + Learn & Create

The team landed on a model with three layers:

**1. Transform (Base layer — always included)**
- The **Transformation OS** platform — the central system of record for the AI transformation journey.
- Primary users: AI transformation lead + leadership team (not the whole company).
- Contains: living playbook, guided onboarding, self-service refresh before quarterly check-ins, roadmap view, project charter creation.
- Quarterly check-ins replace the biweekly execution support.
- The platform handles the "refresh" — before each quarterly session, it guides the client through updating their context (upload latest strategy deck, answer a few questions), so the check-in is substantive.
- Key insight: don't expect clients to log in daily. Instead, reach them where they are (Slack, Teams, WhatsApp) with nudges like "thumbs up if things are going well, or tell us if you need help." Only route them to the platform when there's a specific action.

**2. Accelerator Sprints (Add-ons — priced separately)**
Three flavors:
- **Spike** (~10k) — 2-day focused build. Process-oriented. "We do an intake, build for two days, here it is."
- **Sprint** (~20k) — Full week. Can be process or product. More explorative, team involved.
- **Special** (variable pricing) — Topic-specific deep dives. Examples: AI Act compliance, GDPR, commercial model transformation. These are the recurring annual topics (tech, talent, operating model) that can be refreshed each year.

**3. Learn & Create (Add-on — included by default, can be toggled off)**
- The employee-facing side of the platform — training, use case discovery, prompt generation.
- Modeled after Prof AI's approach but built natively: basic AI literacy training, use case generator, prompt library, cards tool.
- Serves the entire organization (not just transformation leads).
- Pricing: consumption-based above a base tier. Tiers based on number of users (e.g., up to 100 for Kickstarter, 250 for Leader).
- This is the retention play — if employees across the company are using it, the platform sticks.

## Engagement Tiers (Setup Cost)

The tiers now primarily define the **depth of the initial strategy work** (the setup), not the ongoing subscription:

| Tier | Setup Focus | Approx. Price | Key Difference |
|------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Kickstarter** | High-level playbook, practical use case focus (no winning moves deep dive) | ~25k/year | Get started, prove value, likely upsell to Accelerator |
| **Accelerator** | Full strategy + playbook with winning moves | ~40-50k | Includes 2 breakthrough sprints |
| **Leader** | Strategy + deep dives on transformation pillars (tech, talent, operating model, commercial model) | ~80k+ | Multiple topic verticals explored in depth |

After year one, all tiers converge to the same Transformation OS subscription + quarterly check-ins. The tier distinction is primarily a **front-loaded setup cost**.

Year two conversation becomes easier: "You're a Tatoma member. You have the platform, quarterly check-ins, and you can add sprints as needed."

## Platform: What Lives Where

### Transformation OS (for transformation leads + leadership)
- Living playbook with guided creation
- Roadmap view with project charters
- Self-service refresh workflow before quarterly sessions
- Guided onboarding (pre-populated based on industry context)
- Sprint/project support tools (briefing creation, design sprint templates)
- Eventually: connectors to client project management tools (Jira, Monday, Notion) to pull AI-labeled projects automatically — avoiding the "yet another platform" problem

### Learn & Create (for the whole organization)
- AI literacy training (similar to Prof AI's one-hour onboarding)
- Use case generator (personal productivity level)
- Prompt library and cards tool
- Webinars / on-demand sessions (industry or function specific)
- Certificates ("Tatoma certified" — doesn't mean much but people can show it)
- Hands-on workshop support (in-person sessions supported by platform tools)

### Key Platform Design Principles
- **Don't compete with their Jira/Monday** — the platform should export to their existing tools, not replace them.
- **Don't expect daily logins** — reach clients via their channels (Slack, Teams) with nudges; route to platform only for specific actions.
- **Self-service upsell** — the platform should detect when a client needs a breakthrough sprint and surface that option.
- **The platform IS the differentiator** — "Anyone can be a consultant delivering PowerPoints and Miro. The full package is what differentiates us."

## Industry vs. Function Lens

### Industry Circles
- Primarily a **go-to-market / marketing play** — speak the language, have industry-specific people, pre-populate platform content.
- The product itself doesn't change significantly. Similar to how SaaS companies have industry tabs on their website but the product is the same.
- Current focus: agencies, financial services, "all companies."

### Function/Department Circles
- More interesting for community building — people are more willing to talk to peers from other companies about their department than about their whole business model.
- Examples discussed: HR circle (personnel handbook agent, recruitment AI, team lead coaching), marketing circle.
- Could work as personal memberships (5 HR people get 5 memberships to the HR circle).
- However, company-wide engagement is ultimately more valuable than department-only. Function lens works best as a feature within the full product, not as a standalone offering.

### Decision: Industry is a marketing lens. Function is a community lens. Neither fundamentally changes the product.

## Competitive Positioning (from Miro Board)

### Where Tatoma Sits on Key Axes:
- **Enabler** (not implementer) — "We don't finish the projects. We make sure the organization can."
- **Revolution over evolution** — the sentiment walking into a client should be "this is going to be big" and "this will change the company overall," even if the execution approach is iterative.
- **Premium pricing** — "If you wanna go cheap, go somewhere else."
- **Integrated** (not siloed) — but in a way that leverages what clients already have, not adding complexity.
- **Top of mind** (not just quarterly zooming out) — via platform nudges and learn & create engagement.
- **Specific over generic** — one-size-fits-all product feel, but tailored content.

### Key Competitors Referenced:
- **Section (Prof AI)** — closest to the Learn & Create vision. They pivoted their entire org to product. Good at training + use case discovery. But don't go deep on strategy.
- **Gen AI Strategy** (example consultant) — offers inspiration, strategy, proficiency, execution. Very similar approach to Tatoma but coming from a different angle.
- **Little Rockets / Beyond There** — execution-heavy, detailed ROI reports. Acito had their report but shelved it ("they took a Plex").
- **Nipple (formerly AIII)** — European AI tools platform. Different space but interesting positioning.
- **Good Habits / GoodLearn** — L&D platform, similar territory for the training component.

### The Tatoma Edge (Aspirational):
- The **combination** of strategic consulting + platform + learn & create in one integrated package. Nobody else offers all three connected.
- The platform as the "Transformation OS" — a system of record for the AI transformation, not just a project management tool.
- Skills-based intelligence embedded in the platform (the "secret sauce" in the guided workflows).

## Open Questions & Unresolved Tensions

1. **Will clients get enough value from the platform after year one?** The team is "not sure" but thinks Learn & Create could drive retention if employees build personal libraries of use cases and prompts.

2. **How deep to go on transformation pillars?** Tech, operating model, talent — going deep quickly moves beyond AI scope. For Leader clients, maybe partner with firms like Node One for the tech depth.

3. **Execution support withdrawal** — Can the team really walk away from biweekly check-ins? What happens when the transformation lead "sucks" and nothing gets done between quarters? Proposed solution: platform-led nudges + clear "if you need a breakthrough, order a sprint" model.

4. **Second year pricing** — The value delivered personally drops in year two. Platform + quarterly check-ins needs to carry the pricing. How much can you charge? For Leader clients it's easier (annual deep dive refreshes on pillars). For Kickstarter it's harder.

5. **Product build priorities** — Learn & Create (Prof AI equivalent) is the most urgent build. The Transformation OS workbench already has pieces but needs refinement and clearer UX (currently described as "overwhelming").

6. **Self-service / product-led growth** — The team discussed the possibility of a self-service Transformation OS entry point (no consulting, just the platform). Not for launch, but it's on the horizon.

## Immediate Next Steps Mentioned

- Build out the Learn & Create side of the platform (use the extra Cloth seat + credits).
- Demo progress at the next session ("I'll show you two things").
- Create a pricing calculator.
- Test the revised model against current clients (Acito, Robin, Crow) to see how the transition would work.
- User testing with a lightweight demo of the Transformation OS to validate the "will they come back" question.
- Finalize naming: Kickstarter / Leader for setup tiers. Spike / Sprint / Special for accelerators. "Transformation OS" for the platform.
