- [ ] Quick recap: Blueprint domains + today's goal
- [ ] Confirm: "We'll walk through 4 lifecycle phases, validate tool mappings, spot gaps"
- [ ] Share screen: process mapping table (have CSV open)

### Listen for
- Any changes since last call
- New pain points surfaced while prepping
- Who else might join (3D/Motion team?)

### Probe if needed
> "Before we dive in - anything come up since last week that we should factor in?"

> "Did you get input from the 3D/Motion heroes?"

---

## Block 1: Intake & Briefing (25 min)
**0:15 - 0:40**

### Processes to cover
1. **Lead-to-Opportunity** (Capture → Qualify → Propose → Close)
2. **Brief-to-Kickoff** (Receive → Scope → Staff → Kickoff)

### Questions to ask
> "When a new client project comes in, what's the first thing that happens? Who does what, and in which tool?"

> "How does a brief go from the client's mouth to an actionable task for the creative team?"

> "Who decides which people get assigned to a project, and how do they know who's available?"

### Listen for
| Signal | Indicates |
|--------|-----------|
| "It depends on who receives it" | No standard intake process |
| "Usually email, sometimes Teams" | Channel fragmentation |
| "The PM just knows" | Tribal knowledge, no system of record |
| "Float, but people forget to update it" | Tool adoption issue |
| Mentions of spreadsheets | Shadow IT / workaround |

### Probe deeper
> "What happens when that person is on holiday?"

> "Where does the original brief live after kickoff - can you find it 3 months later?"

> "How often does a project start without a clear brief?"

### Validate table
- [ ] Lead-to-Opportunity: systems correct?
- [ ] Brief-to-Kickoff: systems correct?
- [ ] Any stages missing?
- [ ] Any tools not listed?

### Time check
- At 0:30: Start wrapping, move to Brief-to-Kickoff if still on Lead-to-Opportunity
- At 0:38: "Let's capture what we have and move to Production"

---

## Block 2: Production & Handoffs (20 min)
**0:40 - 1:00**

### Processes to cover
1. **Concept-to-Delivery** (Ideate → Produce → Review → Revise → Approve)
2. **Request-to-Fulfill** (Request → Evaluate → Provision → Enable)

### Questions to ask
> "Walk me through what happens between 'brief approved' and 'first deliverable to client' — what are the steps, and where does it get stuck most often?"

> "When creative work needs review, how does that flow? Where do feedback rounds happen?"

> "What happens when a 3D/Motion request comes in that requires a new tool or plugin?"

### Listen for
| Signal | Indicates |
|--------|-----------|
| "Frame.io for video, Figma comments for design" | Fragmented review |
| "Clients email feedback" | Feedback outside system |
| "We wait for IT" / "People find workarounds" | Shadow IT driver |
| "Render queue is a bottleneck" | Resource optimization opportunity |
| "Version control is messy" | Asset management gap |

### Probe deeper
> "When feedback comes in multiple places, who consolidates it?"

> "How long does a typical tool request take to get approved?"

> "What's the most recent workaround someone found because the official process was too slow?"

### Validate table
- [ ] Concept-to-Delivery: systems correct?
- [ ] Request-to-Fulfill: systems correct?
- [ ] Shadow IT tools to add?

### Time check
- At 0:55: "Five minutes to break - let's capture key points"
- At 1:00: "Let's take 5-10 minutes, back at [time]"

---

## BREAK (5-10 min)
**1:00 - 1:10**

Quick notes while on break:
- [ ] Star any "aha" moments from first half
- [ ] Note tools mentioned that aren't in current mapping
- [ ] Identify biggest pain point so far

---

## Block 3: Delivery & Knowledge (25 min)
**1:10 - 1:35**

### Processes to cover
1. **Deliver-to-Archive** (Finalize → Deliver → Archive → Reflect)
2. **Time-to-Cash** (Track → Validate → Invoice → Collect)

### Questions to ask
> "When a project is delivered, where does the final work live? Is it findable 6 months later by someone who wasn't on the project?"

> "Do teams run retros or post-mortems? If so, where do those insights go?"

> "Walk me through: project done → invoice sent. What are the steps and who touches it?"

### Listen for
| Signal | Indicates |
|--------|-----------|
| "Honestly, it's hard to find old work" | Archive/search gap (BIG) |
| "We don't really do retros" | No feedback loop |
| "LucidLink / local drives / SharePoint" | Fragmented storage |
| "Time tracking is always a fight" | Time-to-cash friction |
| "Finance chases people for hours" | Manual reconciliation |

### Probe deeper
> "If I joined as a new creative tomorrow and needed to find a similar project from last year, how would I do that?"

> "When a senior creative leaves, what happens to their project files and knowledge?"

> "What percentage of billable time do you think actually gets captured?"

### Validate table
- [ ] Deliver-to-Archive: systems correct? (Expect gaps in Archive/Reflect)
- [ ] Time-to-Cash: systems correct?
- [ ] Memory & Retrieval gap confirmed?

### Red flag moment
This is where you'll likely confirm the **knowledge memory gap**. When you hear it, name it:

> "So if I'm hearing right, there's no single place where project knowledge lives after delivery, and when people leave, that context goes with them. That's a pattern we see a lot - and it's one of the highest-value areas for AI to help."

### Time check
- At 1:30: Start transitioning to Operations
- At 1:33: "Two more minutes on this, then let's look at recurring patterns"

---

## Block 4: Operations & Patterns (15 min)
**1:35 - 1:50**

### Processes to cover
1. **Hire-to-Retire** (Recruit → Onboard → Develop → Perform → Offboard)
2. **Issue-to-Resolution** (Report → Diagnose → Resolve → Document)
3. **Report-to-Insight** (Collect → Aggregate → Interpret → Act)

### Questions to ask
> "What work does your team do every week/month that feels repetitive but still requires a person?"

> "Are there any workflows documented as SOPs, or do most processes live in people's heads?"

> "When someone new joins, how long until they're fully set up with all tools and access?"

### Listen for
| Signal | Indicates |
|--------|-----------|
| "Status updates every Monday" | Automation candidate |
| "Reporting takes half a day" | Report-to-Insight opportunity |
| "Onboarding takes 2 weeks" | Hire-to-Retire friction |
| "It's in someone's head" | SOP gap, knowledge risk |
| "We use tickets but..." | Issue-to-Resolution gaps |

### Probe deeper
> "If you could wave a magic wand and automate one recurring task, what would it be?"

> "What's the most annoying thing about the monthly reporting cycle?"

> "When IT resolves an issue, where does that solution get documented for next time?"

### Validate table
- [ ] Hire-to-Retire: systems correct? (Especially offboard)
- [ ] Issue-to-Resolution: systems correct?
- [ ] Report-to-Insight: systems correct?

### Time check
- At 1:48: "Let's move to wrap-up and priorities"

---

## Block 5: Wrap-up & Priorities (10 min)
**1:50 - 2:00**

### Agenda
- [ ] Recap: key gaps identified
- [ ] Recap: quick win candidates
- [ ] Align on top 3 priorities for AI opportunities
- [ ] Next steps & timeline

### Summary prompt
> "Based on what we've covered, I'm hearing three big themes: [X], [Y], [Z]. Does that match your sense of priorities?"

### Priority candidates (from prep)
| Area | Opportunity | Effort |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Time-to-Cash | Invoice drafting from time entries | Medium |
| Knowledge/Offboard | Exit interviews + knowledge capture | Medium |
| Brief-to-Proposal | Auto-draft proposals from briefs | Low-Med |
| Reporting | Narrative generation for dashboards | Low |

### Closing questions
> "Of these, which would have the biggest impact on your team's day-to-day?"

> "Who else should we involve to move forward on [top priority]?"

> "What's the best way to share the updated mapping with your team for feedback?"

### Next steps to propose
- [ ] Share updated process mapping (cleaned up from session)
- [ ] Schedule deep-dive on top 1-2 priorities
- [ ] Identify pilot users for first AI capability

## Notes During Session

### Tools mentioned (not in current mapping)
- **Encodify** - Replaced Monday.com as primary PM tool (modules: QC, project mgmt, client portal)
- **Weave AI** - Container subscription for AI tools (Runway, Cling, Flux, video models)
- **ComfyUI** - Local AI workflows (testing phase)
- **Microsoft Loop** - Workflow docs, client process guidelines
- **Zoios** - Pulse surveys (monthly), 1:1 journals, EDP tracking
- **Deltek Maconomy Cloud** - Time registration, budgets, invoicing
- **Issue** - CGI task management (internal)
- **LucidLink** - File access layer to Backblaze storage (3 buckets, hot storage)
- **Kudos system** - Coming in ~1 month for recognition

### Tools corrected
- Monday.com → Downgraded to archive only
- Discord/Midjourney → NON-COMPLIANT (one client exception)
- WeTransfer → Being phased out (internal FTP replacement)
- Asana → Client-side only, not internal
- No HR system exists (under investigation)

### Key pain points
1. **Briefing fragmentation** - No standard intake process. Email/Teams chaos. Brief type (production vs creative) determines info needed but no system helps identify which.
2. **Manual estimation effort** - "We've done this 100 times, why are we estimating?" No lookup of similar past projects.
3. **Project health reactive** - Discover budget overruns after the fact. Leo: "Instead of them coming to us asking why profit is bad, agent could alert during production."
4. **Cross-department holiday blindness** - Resource conflicts when people book holidays, other dept's producers don't know. Recent retro cited this exact issue.
5. **Knowledge in heads** - No retros except major issues. Knowledge leaves when people leave. Guidelines in Loop but not connected to anything.
6. **Tool request friction** - Leo fills compliance forms with info he doesn't know ("Does it follow GDPR? I have no idea")
7. **Archive pressure** - Hot storage filling up, manual cold migration process needed

### Quick wins identified
1. **Brief completeness checker** - AI flags "you're missing resolution/frame rate" based on brief type
2. **Estimation assistant** - Query Maconomy for similar past projects, suggest baseline
3. **Project health alerts** - Connect Float + Maconomy + absence data for proactive warnings
4. **Tool compliance auto-fill** - AI gathers vendor info so requesters only provide use case

### Three themes confirmed
1. **Intake Intelligence** - Brief parsing, type detection, completeness checking
2. **Predictive Project Health** - Budget alerts, resource conflicts, absence overlaps
3. **Historical Memory** - Similar project lookup, estimation assist, knowledge capture

### Leo's specific requests (3D Motion)
- Agent to assess brief completeness based on project type
- Estimation lookup from historical data
- Proactive project health monitoring (not just retrospective)
- Cross-reference absence data with project bookings
- Eventually: AI that learns to use software via video (mentioned Gemini, Claude Cowork)

### Follow-up actions
- [x] Simon sending Shadow IT list
- [x] Simon sending AI policies (internal/external)

- [ ] Coordinate with Nicholas (new Head of AI, starts Feb 2)
- [ ] Potentially talk to Finance (owns Power BI) during sprint
- [ ] Adobe Firefly collaboration ongoing (Simon facilitating)

### Budget & Resources
- **575,000 DKK** approved for Microsoft Agent projects
- Nicholas starts Feb 2, vacation week in between, strategy meeting Feb 20
- Lack of internal resources to build (just Leo + one other for AI workflows)
