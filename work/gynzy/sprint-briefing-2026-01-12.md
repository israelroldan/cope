## Overview

This Sprint briefing outlines Gynzy's initiative to accelerate customer onboarding through the Gynzyfication process. The Sprint addresses the challenge of scaling personalized segment communication, which currently requires excessive manual intervention, preventing consistent action across all customer segments while maintaining content relevance and proper segmentation.

## Problem Definition

### Problem Statement

Gynzy's current approach to personalized segment communication demands substantial manual effort, requiring teams to activate individual flows and manage segments one by one. This labor-intensive process prevents the organization from acting consistently across all customer segments while maintaining the quality and relevance of personalized content. The challenge lies in determining how to create appropriate segments, develop relevant content, and systematically scale this personalized approach without compromising the effectiveness that drives customers through the Gynzyfication journey.

### Main Goal for the Sprint

**Accelerate Gynzyfication through more personalized audience communication by improving multiple steps in the conversion path.**

### Sub-Goals We Want to Achieve

1. Create an end-to-end automated process for generating smart segments and building optimized communication flows automatically
2. Assess whether the team possesses the necessary competencies to execute scalable personalized communication effectively and if not, how to strengthen the team?
3. Explore alternative tooling options and industry best practices to inform the approach

## Validation

### Target Group Description

The validation approach involves two distinct process validation groups that will test the automated workflows and segmentation approaches developed during the Sprint. Additionally, three specific customer representatives (Klant 1, Klant 2, Klant 3) will validate the effectiveness of personalized communication strategies and assess whether the brand experience remains consistent throughout their Gynzyfication journey.

This dual validation approach ensures both technical process verification and real-world customer experience validation.

## Key Observations

### Alignment with COPE Assessment

| Briefing Goal | Maps to COPE Layer |
|---------------|-------------------|
| End-to-end automated process for smart segments | P1 (behavior-based) + P2 (AI microsegmentation) |
| Building optimized communication flows automatically | P2 (AI-assisted flow creation) |
| Team competency assessment | New — organizational readiness |
| Alternative tooling + best practices | Research synthesis (done) |

### New Elements Not in Previous Prep

1. **Team competency assessment** — explicit goal to evaluate if team can execute
2. **Guest speakers** — Menno (Neople) and Willem (With Locals) bringing external perspective
3. **Customer validation** — 3 real customers validating the approach
4. **Brevo** — tool mentioned, unclear current role
5. **Process validation groups** — structured testing approach

### Questions to Clarify Today

1. What role does **Brevo** play? (email? separate from Intercom?)
2. When are **Menno and Willem** speaking? What topics?
3. Who are **Klant 1, 2, 3**? When is customer validation happening?
4. What does **process validation** look like? Thursday?
