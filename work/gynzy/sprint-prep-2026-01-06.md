# Gynzy Sprint Prep - Sander Call

## Sprint Overview

**Type:** AI Sprint (not classic design sprint)
**Dates:** Monday-Thursday, January 12-16
**Location:** TBD (Sander checking Charles location at the malls)

## Goal

Human-in-the-loop process with smarter tooling — NOT fully automated segmentation engine.

> "We're not gonna end up with a completely automated dynamic segment builder... there will be human in the loop steps where you can push the button"

## Expected Outcome

- Help consolidate 50+ audiences into manageable groups
- Behavior-based triggers for auto-cohorts
- AI-assisted audience segmentation (not full automation)
- Smarter tooling to scale from 50 → 150 audiences without 3x staff

**Framing:** "The ultimate personal communication engine for Gynzy"

---

## Monday Agenda (Jan 12)

1. **Validate shared insights** — from briefing sessions with Maria/team
2. **Process mapping** — as-is → to-be
3. **Benchmarking** — with external examples
4. **Creative directions** — concept for "personal communication engine"

Then Tue-Wed for building, Thursday for validation.

## Key Discussion Points

### Sprint Approach

- **AI Sprint** format, not classic design sprint
- Start from process mapping, not tools
- Balance client involvement vs internal solution work
- Use Martin's process optimization sprint template as reference

### Prototype Direction

Not building:
- Fully automated segment builder
- Communication optimization engine

Building:
- Process + tooling for human-in-the-loop segmentation
- Prompt/agent to help consolidate audiences into groups
- Behavior-based triggers for auto-cohorts in campaigns

### External Benchmarks Needed

Looking for B2C platform examples of:
- How they build audiences (automatic?)
- How they build communication flows
- Segmentation at scale

Potential: Customer.io case study (Israel has CS contact)

## Process Flow (Agreed)

```
Monday AM:    Validate shared insights
Monday PM:    Process mapping + benchmarking
              → Creative directions

Tue-Wed:      Build prototype/concept

Thursday:     Validate with team (process walkthrough or individual testing)
```

---

## Notes

- They have 50 audiences with 50 communication flows currently
- Could grow to 150 audiences / 250 flows — impossible to manage with 3 people
- Intercom is being used but not to its potential (same was true at Customer.io)
- Consider: Custom GPT for cohort grouping suggestions
- Frame as product concept, not just process optimization
