## What is Gynzyfication?

**Gynzyfication** is Gynzy's strategic process for converting schools from initial awareness through to full institutional adoption and expansion.

## The Gynzyfication Funnel

```
Attract → Acquire → Activate → Penetrate → Inflate → Convert
```

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Attract** | Awareness, website visits, marketing reach |
| **Acquire** | Account created, teacher signs up |
| **Activate** | Teacher using the platform regularly |
| **Penetrate** | Multiple teachers at same school using Gynzy |
| **Inflate** | Growing usage/adoption within the school |
| **Convert** | School-wide institutional deal, paying customer |

## Strategic Goals

### 1. Gynzyfication van Scholen (School Gynzyfication)
- Use **AI as a lever** to accelerate Gynzyfication
- Target: **minimum 100 Flemish schools**
- Activate teachers to use the technology
- Outcome: more integrated learning environment

### 2. Nieuwe Klanten Werven (New Customer Acquisition)
- Acquire **100 new schools** in Netherlands and Flanders
- Convert them to paying customers
- Support their transition to improved learning environment

### 3. Efficiëntie en Personalisatie (Efficiency & Personalization)
- Integrate AI into the platform
- Deliver more efficient learning experience
- Provide personalized learning for students
- Drive better learning outcomes

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| New schools (NL + Flanders) | 100 |
| Flemish schools Gynzyfied | 100 |
| Conversion type | Activated teacher → Penetrated school |

## Strategic Insight

The Gynzyfication strategy is a **land-and-expand** model:
1. **Land**: Get individual teachers activated on the platform
2. **Expand**: Convert school-wide adoption ("penetration")
3. **AI lever**: Use AI features to accelerate both stages

This explains why the sprint focus is on understanding and optimizing the Gynzyfication process - it's the core growth mechanism.
