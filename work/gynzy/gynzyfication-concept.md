# Gynzyfication: Concept Overview

*Distilled from internal Gynzy presentation slides, January 2026*

## What is Gynzyfication?

**Gynzyfication** is Gynzy's strategic process for converting schools from having individual activated teachers to becoming fully "penetrated" schools where the platform is institutionally adopted.

## The Conversion Journey

```
Activated Teacher → Penetrated School
```

| Stage | Dutch Term | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **Activated Teacher** | Geactiveerde leerkracht | Individual teacher using Gynzy |
| **Penetrated School** | Penetrated school | School-wide institutional adoption |

## Strategic Goals

### 1. Gynzyfication van Scholen (School Gynzyfication)
- Use **AI as a lever** to accelerate Gynzyfication
- Target: **minimum 100 Flemish schools**
- Activate teachers to use the technology
- Outcome: more integrated learning environment

### 2. Nieuwe Klanten Werven (New Customer Acquisition)
- Acquire **100 new schools** in Netherlands and Flanders
- Convert them to paying customers
- Support their transition to improved learning environment

### 3. Efficiëntie en Personalisatie (Efficiency & Personalization)
- Integrate AI into the platform
- Deliver more efficient learning experience
- Provide personalized learning for students
- Drive better learning outcomes

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| New schools (NL + Flanders) | 100 |
| Flemish schools Gynzyfied | 100 |
| Conversion type | Activated teacher → Penetrated school |

## Strategic Insight

The Gynzyfication strategy is a **land-and-expand** model:
1. **Land**: Get individual teachers activated on the platform
2. **Expand**: Convert school-wide adoption ("penetration")
3. **AI lever**: Use AI features to accelerate both stages

This explains why the sprint focus is on understanding and optimizing the Gynzyfication process - it's the core growth mechanism.
