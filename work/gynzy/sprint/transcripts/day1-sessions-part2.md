## 1. B2B Software Value Proposition
**Time:** 13:45 - 13:50 (5:37)

The conversation touches on high-end B2B contact centers and the challenge of clearly conveying the added value of a software product to end users. One speaker mentions that users cannot yet see a direct return or benefit from going through all the steps, suggesting the product's value proposition is not fully realized. They speculate that prospects might be looking for a gap they can fill with this software and that marketing based on specific quotes or use cases could help.

**Key points:**
- B2B software lacking clear user value demonstration
- Users need to see direct ROI from completing steps
- Marketing opportunities through use cases and quotes

## 2. Optimizing Onboarding Flows With AI
**Time:** 13:52 - 14:09 (17:16)

Participants discuss improving educational content workflows and onboarding flows, partially in Dutch and English. They talk about using AI to make code changes and automate content generation, aiming to reduce the time and effort needed to create and maintain content for different teachers and segments. One speaker encourages the group to define specific "opportunities" (e.g., creating a content generation engineer role/workflow) with clear goals, target users, and measurable process improvements.

**Key points:**
- AI for code changes and content automation
- Reducing manual content creation time
- Content generation engineer role proposal
- Questions about flow structure in Figma vs Intercom
- Legacy tools never optimized for scale
- Flow overlap and data analysis considerations
- When flows become inactive or are removed

## 3. Onboarding And Penetration Flows, Figma To Intercom
**Time:** 14:12 - 14:31 (19:49)

The group discusses improving product usage flows for schools, focusing on differentiating between onboarding/activation and deeper penetration of existing users. They talk about capturing and leveraging more in-product signals (beyond just new account creation and reactivation) to increase engagement once a school is already using the product. There is a concern about how and when users should transition from an onboarding flow to a penetration/usage flow, and how communication (emails, banners, etc.) should be coordinated across these states.

**Key points:**
- School-level vs user-level signals
- Transition from onboarding to penetration flows
- Risk of information loss when translating from Figma to Intercom
- Suggestion: Intercom as source of truth, with Figma updates
- Prioritization exercise: impact vs effort
- 30-minute individual task to identify top 5 opportunities

## 4. Tatoma Product Framework, AI Tagging Assistant
**Time:** 14:34 - 15:01 (27:07)

The group refines a Tatoma-style framework for product building, aiming to generate one-page briefs for prototypes (including an AI tagging assistant and a flow generator for marketing automation). They discuss using AI cards and assistants as co-facilitators to capture ideas, constraints, and data flows, with the goal of eventually productizing their consultancy.

**Key points:**
- **TATOMA framework:** Target, Assumptions, Thin slice, Test, One-page, Minimal build, After-action capture
- AI tagging assistant for automated property creation from behavioral data
- Flow generator taking natural language goals to flow definitions
- Air traffic control logic for overlapping campaign management
- Integration with Intercom, BigQuery, Census, Customer.io, Figma
- **API constraints: can't create/modify Intercom flows via API**
- Human-in-the-loop requirement
- Buying .me domain for short URLs
- Scaling and monetizing Kickstarter program
- Automating deliverables with AI presentations

## 5. AI Content Personalization, Smart Segments
**Time:** 15:02 - 15:14 (11:48)

The team holds a product discussion about using AI to improve marketing content and customer communication flows. They talk about generating dynamic content and building blocks for emails, with AI assisting in creating or suggesting new content rather than fully replacing manual work. Another focus is on using AI-based smart segments that automatically update based on user behavior and data, reducing time-consuming manual segmentation for the marketing team.

**Key points:**
- Dynamic content generation with building blocks
- AI-generated content suggestions (not replacement)
- Smart segments that auto-update based on behavior
- Behavior-driven flow triggering
- Avoiding generic messaging
- Maintaining onboarding flow alongside behavior-triggered communications

---

## 6. Recommendation Engine Concept
**Time:** 15:16 - 15:25 (9:24)

The group informally discusses ideas for a recommendation engine. One participant explains a conceptual model using users on the X-axis and content on the Y-axis, calculating similarity between content to identify clusters of users and form groups. They touch on how this can support advisory or mixed recommendations, making it possible to understand which combinations to propose.

**Key points:**
- User-content matrix model (users on X-axis, content on Y-axis)
- Similarity calculations to form user clusters
- Advisory and mixed recommendation approaches
- Making milestones and successes visible in communication and product
- High-level exploratory discussion

## 7. Intent-Based Messaging, Prioritization
**Time:** 15:29 - 15:46 (17:26)

The group discusses how to structure and optimize user communications based on clear intent and goals. They talk about defining the objective behind each message or flow and using user data and product data to automatically propose personalized messages, next-best-actions, and flows. One participant clarifies that the focus is less on the exact flow and more on capturing the intent for each goal, then letting tooling or AI generate or suggest tailored content and sequences per user segment.

**Key points:**
- Intent-based messaging over exact flow definitions
- Next-best-action suggestions
- Advisory tool to move users between lifecycle stages (activated → engaged)
- Oversight of all current communications and methods
- Color-coded prioritization exercise (blue, yellow, red, pink, purple)
- Selecting top priorities to work on concretely

## 8. Prototype Tasks For The Week
**Time:** 16:02 - 16:08 (5:47)

The group discusses wrapping up the current meeting and continuing work the next day in a tracking session. They want to define the top one to three priorities for this week and work together on a prototype for version 0.1 or 2 of their model. Tomorrow they also plan to review and share additional actions, ensure they have the right insights for their project, and explore whether they can schedule a test with a partner to gain access and feedback.

**Key points:**
- Define top 1-3 priorities for the week
- Work on prototype v0.1 or v0.2
- Tomorrow: tracking session
- Additional action items to share
- Test with partner (possibly "Kusmeer") for access/feedback
- New ideas should be considered through audience and concrete action lenses
