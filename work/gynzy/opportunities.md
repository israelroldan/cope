# Gynzy AI Opportunities

> Marketing Week: January 12, 2026

## Context

**Goal:** Help Gynzy leverage AI to improve user cohort classification for targeted marketing campaigns

### Current State
- Using **Intercom** for onboarding + drip campaigns
- Mixed success with current approach
- Want smarter segmentation based on user characteristics

### Discovery Focus Areas

| Area | Questions to Answer |
|------|---------------------|
| **Intercom setup** | How are they using it? What data flows through? What triggers campaigns today? |
| **ETL / Data pipeline** | Where does user data live? How does it get to Intercom? What enrichment exists? |
| **Available data** | What signals do they have? Usage patterns, user attributes, engagement metrics? |
| **Intercom AI capabilities** | What can Intercom do natively? Where are the gaps an external AI could fill? |

## AI Integration Opportunities

### 1. Cohort Classification (Primary Ask)
- AI-driven user segmentation beyond manual rules
- Classify users by behavior patterns, not just attributes
- Dynamic cohort assignment as behavior evolves

### 2. Campaign Content Personalization
- Dynamic email/message copy based on user role, usage patterns, school type
- Localized tone (experienced teacher vs. new teacher)
- Feature highlights tailored to what they haven't discovered yet

### 3. Predictive Churn & Intervention
- Identify users showing disengagement signals before they churn
- Trigger proactive outreach ("We noticed you haven't tried X...")
- Prioritize CS attention on high-value at-risk accounts

### 4. Optimal Send Time / Channel
- Learn when each user segment is most responsive
- A/B test → AI model for timing optimization
- Channel preference (email vs. in-app vs. push)

### 5. Smart Onboarding Paths
- Adaptive onboarding based on early behavior
- Skip steps for power users, slow down for strugglers
- "Choose your own adventure" driven by AI classification

### 6. Support Deflection & Routing
- AI triage incoming Intercom chats
- Auto-suggest help articles before human handoff
- Route complex issues to right specialist based on context

### 7. Content Generation at Scale
- Generate campaign variants for A/B testing
- Translate/localize campaigns automatically
- Create personalized "tips" based on usage data

### 8. Feedback Loop Intelligence
- Analyze survey responses, NPS comments, support tickets
- Surface themes: "Teachers in segment X complain about Y"
- Feed insights back into campaign targeting

### 9. Usage-Based Upsell Triggers
- Detect when a user/school hits limits or shows expansion signals
- Personalized upgrade messaging based on actual usage
- "You've created 50 lessons — teams like yours typically upgrade for..."
