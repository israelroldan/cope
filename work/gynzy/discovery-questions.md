# Gynzy Discovery Questions

> Marketing Week: January 12, 2026

## Data & Infrastructure

- What user events do you track? (logins, feature usage, lesson creation, etc.)
- Where does this data live? (Postgres, BigQuery, etc.)
- How real-time is the data in Intercom?
- Any data enrichment today? (firmographics, school size, plan tier?)
- How does data flow from source → Intercom? (direct, Segment, custom sync?)

## Current Intercom Usage

- Walk us through your main campaigns (onboarding, re-engagement, upsell)
- How do you segment users today? Manual tags? Filters?
- What's working? What's frustrating?
- Any campaigns you've turned off because they didn't perform?

## AI Landscape

- Which AI provider(s) are you using? *(touched on in December — confirm)*
- Who owns AI budget/governance internally?
- Any security policies or constraints? (EU-only, no external APIs, etc.)

## Success Metrics

- How do you measure campaign effectiveness?
- What does "better classification" look like? (conversion? engagement? retention?)
- Any specific user segments you struggle to reach?

## Wishlist

- If you could wave a magic wand, what would AI do for you?
- Any "we wish we could..." moments?

## Catch-all

> "Any constraints we should know about?"

Opens the door for IT/infra concerns without committing to that scope.
