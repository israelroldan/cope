## Decisions Made

| Decision | Context |
|----------|---------|
| **Thomas: guide, don't retain** | Help him finish Library/Prompts school project, but won't continue as working student |
| **Maarten → Vercel + GitHub** | Onboarded for preview deployments and issue creation |
| **Demo-then-refine culture** | Ship demos fast, iterate based on feedback |
| **Miro as CMS** | Miro feeds content into Landscape app |
| **Weekly product check-in** | Recurring Mondays with Maarten |

## Tasks

- APQC process frameworks
- Map client processes to identify AI opportunities

### Landscape Evolution
- Current: visualize AI/tool ecosystems
- Future: visual transformation timeline
- Surface "five winning moves" and opportunities

### Personal AI Assistant Interface
- Nicer UX layer on top of Claude Code
- Target: non-developers who want AI assistance
- Could be a product play
